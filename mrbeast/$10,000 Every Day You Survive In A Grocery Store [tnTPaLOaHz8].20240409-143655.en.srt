1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:07,360
I just bought this entire grocery store which includes enough food to literally feed an entire city

2
0:00:07,360 --> 0:00:10,560
and then I decided to trap this random guy inside

3
0:00:10,560 --> 0:00:15,200
and every day you live here I will give you $10,000 in a grocery cart

4
0:00:15,200 --> 0:00:18,240
that's wild dude let's go well I'll give it to you in 24 hours

5
0:00:18,240 --> 0:00:22,160
oh okay this challenge could literally make Alex a multi-millionaire

6
0:00:22,160 --> 0:00:24,880
which in theory means he could be in here for years

7
0:00:24,880 --> 0:00:27,840
and it starts right now all right Jimmy's gone

8
0:00:27,840 --> 0:00:31,920
why would I ever leave I could be here for years time to go grocery shopping baby

9
0:00:31,920 --> 0:00:36,560
now if Alex crosses this red line that we painted around the entire perimeter of the grocery store

10
0:00:36,560 --> 0:00:39,360
the challenge is over and he walks away with his current winnings

11
0:00:39,360 --> 0:00:43,200
and to make sure he stays inside it's worth noting here that we have countless

12
0:00:43,200 --> 0:00:45,920
cameras covering every square inch of the grocery store

13
0:00:45,920 --> 0:00:48,720
for my first meal on night one I guess I'll cook the steak

14
0:00:48,720 --> 0:00:52,880
I think this is just gonna be home base this little corner of the grocery store

15
0:00:52,880 --> 0:00:56,320
if I have meals like this every night I'll easily be here for years

16
0:00:56,400 --> 0:01:00,880
day one complete see you in the morning it has officially been 24 hours and I got the first

17
0:01:00,880 --> 0:01:05,600
10 grand Alex hey do you feel this and confirm it's $10,000

18
0:01:05,600 --> 0:01:11,120
um it is I believe you now we introduce the twist of the challenge

19
0:01:11,120 --> 0:01:16,640
basically to receive the daily $10,000 you need to give me $10,000 in product from the store

20
0:01:16,640 --> 0:01:22,080
and so you have to strategize what order to give rid of these items to stay here as long as possible

21
0:01:22,080 --> 0:01:25,600
oh wow okay conveniently there's a lot of electronics over there that are pretty

22
0:01:25,600 --> 0:01:30,400
expensive for day one that's probably a good idea I can't really eat a tv so it's no use to me

23
0:01:31,520 --> 0:01:37,280
you're 22 cents over all right let me check out do you have nbp card no would you like one no you

24
0:01:37,280 --> 0:01:44,160
want to sign up for here's your cash Chris take it away I will see you tomorrow with another

25
0:01:44,160 --> 0:01:48,400
$10,000 in cash you should start strategizing what you're gonna sell me this changes everything

26
0:01:48,400 --> 0:01:52,800
I gotta start strategizing for the future I have to figure out all the stuff that I need

27
0:01:52,800 --> 0:02:00,000
to get rid of pet food pet items Jimmy cannot pay me to eat this stuff I swear I got $10,000 worth of

28
0:02:00,000 --> 0:02:04,320
dog food right here I think I'm just gonna get some rest wake up early because I'm gonna have to prep

29
0:02:04,320 --> 0:02:13,760
more items tomorrow I got a lot of work ahead of me Alex what's up Jimmy is that what you're

30
0:02:13,760 --> 0:02:18,960
selling to me today it's dog food oh my gosh this is gonna take us forever to move wait can

31
0:02:18,960 --> 0:02:26,880
we do like that I let them clap transition go for it there we go it's all over here at the register

32
0:02:26,880 --> 0:02:34,080
isn't that a cool effect I love beast magic you're at $9,991.80 and for the final item we are now at

33
0:02:34,080 --> 0:02:40,160
$10,045 and something you should know every single item Alex sells to me we are literally gonna

34
0:02:40,160 --> 0:02:43,600
donate to charity so don't worry none of this is gonna go to waste the next few days we're

35
0:02:43,600 --> 0:02:48,320
kind of a breeze for Alex on day five he's so many $10,000 worth of produce all this

36
0:02:48,320 --> 0:02:53,840
produce here they're gonna go bad very fast on day six he sold me a bunch of diapers and on day seven

37
0:02:53,840 --> 0:02:58,800
eight and nine he cleared out an additional $30,000 worth of products he even discovered the back

38
0:02:58,800 --> 0:03:03,440
room of the store and since he hasn't showered in 10 days he built his very own makeshift shower

39
0:03:04,800 --> 0:03:11,200
and laundry system hey how's it going what's up Jimmy all right as of now give me an honest

40
0:03:11,200 --> 0:03:15,760
answer how far do you think you're gonna go oh I mean I feel like a hundred days for sure

41
0:03:15,760 --> 0:03:21,520
oh boy depending on how long Alex lasts this may just become my most expensive video ever but

42
0:03:21,520 --> 0:03:29,280
I'm prepared for that I don't care if you go a year I got the money who put all this in here is

43
0:03:29,280 --> 0:03:35,840
what I wanted the bank you will get this once I get my $10,000 in items all right today I have

44
0:03:35,840 --> 0:03:41,600
more TVs who goes to a grocery store to buy a TV why are these here now Alex to be honest

45
0:03:41,600 --> 0:03:48,080
with me did you empty out any of these TV boxes film with rocks and keep the TV uh dogs

46
0:03:49,920 --> 0:03:52,240
all right I trust him even though that was not what I was asking

47
0:03:56,640 --> 0:04:00,720
approaching day 11 Alex began to get pretty efficient at picking which items to sell

48
0:04:01,680 --> 0:04:07,600
$10,001.89 and since I had to leave to go film a video where I straightened myself on an island

49
0:04:07,600 --> 0:04:12,640
this is not comfortable but let's pray we get like 30 minutes of sleep tonight we had someone else

50
0:04:12,640 --> 0:04:22,320
drop off the money for Alex we call him the money man thank you sir $100,000 I could definitely

51
0:04:22,320 --> 0:04:27,520
reach a million and what he did with the rest of his time to keep himself entertained was interesting

52
0:04:27,600 --> 0:04:34,000
I'm building a cheese ball wall it's done the great wall of cheese balls

53
0:04:43,440 --> 0:04:51,760
it was worth it it was so worth it on day 13 Alex decided to upgrade his shower because

54
0:04:51,760 --> 0:04:59,920
it's a piece of crap what I'm gonna do is use four of these shelves to reinforce the shower okay here we go

55
0:05:09,200 --> 0:05:15,600
I'm gonna use plastic liner drape it across here the walls are waterproof now all right you

56
0:05:15,600 --> 0:05:20,480
gotta give it to him this man is literally constructing a functioning shower out of just

57
0:05:20,480 --> 0:05:24,480
raw store parts damn there it is shower's done time to test it

58
0:05:31,040 --> 0:05:36,000
okay it's been a few days in here I'm gonna build a wall now I never thought I'd see this but Alex

59
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:40,720
literally used all the water bottles in the entire store to build walls for his makeshift

60
0:05:40,720 --> 0:05:45,280
shelter he even created a bed using all of the toilet paper and it looked kind of comfortable

61
0:05:45,840 --> 0:05:48,480
this is pretty cozy I have to fall asleep right here

62
0:05:55,680 --> 0:06:00,640
I gotta get the scan in kind of had my eyes on these bad boys for a while gift cards these

63
0:06:00,640 --> 0:06:05,360
things are freaking expensive it is actually surprising how expensive birthday cards are

64
0:06:05,360 --> 0:06:10,720
because Alex was able to hit his $10,000 mark only using the cards and after I got back from

65
0:06:10,720 --> 0:06:15,280
filming at the island all right hey it's been a while Alex wanted to see if we can help him use

66
0:06:15,280 --> 0:06:19,440
the forklift in the back of the store you know if you could get in the store that'd be super helpful

67
0:06:19,440 --> 0:06:21,680
you're sure you're gonna let Chris drive this yeah

68
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:29,200
all right not the bakery I think maybe one more

69
0:06:29,760 --> 0:06:33,760
oh

70
0:06:42,640 --> 0:06:47,440
even though it's only been a day since he last saw me it seemed like Alex really started to miss me

71
0:06:47,440 --> 0:06:51,600
at least that's the only explanation I have for what he's about to do I saw this cut out of

72
0:06:51,600 --> 0:06:56,080
Jimmy over here we're gonna be hanging out a lot of you and I he's just gonna watch make sure

73
0:06:56,160 --> 0:07:05,040
I don't lose count just scanning away for another 10k $10,000 33 cents over the next few days Alex's

74
0:07:05,040 --> 0:07:09,520
efficiency was through the roof thanks to his new forklift so he even had enough time to upgrade

75
0:07:09,520 --> 0:07:15,360
his bed and it was quite the improvement there's so much better and even though Alex's original

76
0:07:15,360 --> 0:07:19,840
goal was to get a million dollars I think we're going for a meal on this one I hope not he started

77
0:07:19,840 --> 0:07:24,080
documenting what he'd spend the money on and came to realize maybe he didn't need to

78
0:07:24,080 --> 0:07:29,360
stay as long as he thought a million dollars is nice in theory I'm still missing out time

79
0:07:29,360 --> 0:07:33,840
with my boys both their birthdays are coming up in the next two months I've never missed a

80
0:07:33,840 --> 0:07:38,320
birthday yet so after thinking about what I want to put the money toward I realize that I need to

81
0:07:38,320 --> 0:07:46,080
at least make $500,000 but right now I only have 200 so in total I got 50 days I gotta be in here

82
0:07:46,080 --> 0:07:52,000
almost halfway there on day 22 Alex decided to absolutely decimate all the goldfish in

83
0:07:52,000 --> 0:08:00,320
the grocery store oh my god okay so this is $10,000 worth of goldfish I could be the army of toddlers

84
0:08:01,440 --> 0:08:06,720
all right thank you sir you're living a regular life now almost you're getting paid 10 grand a

85
0:08:06,720 --> 0:08:20,480
day to miss your family yeah and you can just do this however long you want yeah as you can see

86
0:08:20,560 --> 0:08:25,520
the days started blending together for Alex but eventually the day came where he decided

87
0:08:25,520 --> 0:08:30,400
to sell the water that he originally used for his shelter but since he couldn't sell the empty

88
0:08:30,400 --> 0:08:36,320
shelves in the store he realized they make pretty good walls I'm gonna reinforce the house with

89
0:08:36,320 --> 0:08:54,080
metal shelves as you can see Alex is feeling pretty at home now but what he doesn't know is when

90
0:08:54,080 --> 0:08:58,880
I bought this grocery store I stopped paying the electricity bill so at any point now all the power

91
0:08:58,880 --> 0:09:03,120
is gonna cut off and his freezers won't work the lights won't work and so much more the

92
0:09:03,120 --> 0:09:07,120
challenge is gonna get way harder but to give him some motivation before things get pretty crazy

93
0:09:07,120 --> 0:09:12,400
we thought Alex deserved a reward are you excited to see your dad yeah you ready to do this yeah I

94
0:09:12,400 --> 0:09:17,600
think he might literally cry this is gonna be crazy oh my god okay Alex we have a surprise for you

95
0:09:19,200 --> 0:09:24,400
we brought some special guests hi buddy yesterday you were telling me about how much you missed

96
0:09:24,400 --> 0:09:28,400
your family and I felt kind of bad so to celebrate 30 days we're gonna let you spend the day with

97
0:09:29,200 --> 0:09:30,400

98
0:09:35,520 --> 0:09:39,760
what's happening with all the boxes on the floor I made a race car track oh is that the car

99
0:09:40,720 --> 0:09:41,680

100

109
0:10:43,840 --> 0:10:48,320
grocery store they gave me a form to put like the utilities in my name and I just never filled it out

110
0:10:49,680 --> 0:10:54,080
the cameras and cash register are hooked up to a generator because we need those so what am I

111
0:10:54,080 --> 0:11:00,160
looking at over here okay so I had originally $60,000 ready to go oh my gosh but I assume

112
0:11:00,160 --> 0:11:04,480
now that the power went out you're gonna sell the frozen stuff yeah things have changed we need

113
0:11:04,480 --> 0:11:09,200

115
0:11:13,280 --> 0:11:17,600

0:11:17,600 --> 0:11:21,520
millions of businesses they support in power if only we had a bag that we could put these things

126
0:12:04,400 --> 0:12:10,160
to go film a video in Africa where I built 100 wells well everyone is this the power Alex spent the

127
0:12:10,160 --> 0:12:14,400
rest of his day rushing to get all the frozen food sold so it could be donated because I'll just

128
0:12:14,400 --> 0:12:19,760
be scanning stuff in the dark from now on I really hope Jimmy turns the power on it's gonna

129
0:12:19,760 --> 0:12:24,880
suck I'm not gonna lie being left without power affected Alex way more than I thought it would

130
0:12:24,880 --> 0:12:28,000
I guess the food wasn't the only thing getting checked out

131
0:12:32,720 --> 0:12:35,040
what if you can tip over a forklift

132
0:12:38,160 --> 0:12:39,760

0:14:53,760 --> 0:14:56,960

153
0:14:56,960 --> 0:15:13,680
forklift all right time for me to not be here anymore we'll see you tomorrow here's your boom

0:15:14,400 --> 0:15:19,840
thanks guys enjoy cleaning after spending an entire day cleaning up Chris's mess I was took

155
0:15:19,840 --> 0:15:23,760
advantage of the newly open space to set up a pool he found in the back off we go

156
0:15:24,240 --> 0:15:31,200
I'm gonna drag the hose out here stick it in this pool and sometime tomorrow

157
0:15:31,200 --> 0:15:36,240
we'll have a grocery swimming pool it's been over a week and Chandler won't tell me what

158
0:15:36,240 --> 0:15:40,560
happened while it's gone this place looks completely different oh god open the doors I gotta see this

159
0:15:41,280 --> 0:15:46,080

160
0:15:46,080 --> 0:15:50,160

0:16:07,680 --> 0:16:12,400
we should check out thanks for the groceries enjoy your pool all right I'm just gonna grab

164
0:16:12,400 --> 0:16:16,800
everything from the back and just put it up here organize it and who knows maybe there's

165
0:16:16,800 --> 0:16:21,440
something fun in there it's no secret at this point Alex was pretty tired and while he was making

166
0:16:21,440 --> 0:16:43,920
his rounds in the forklift something unexpected happened oh dude no oh my god I was trying to

167
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:50,880

191
0:19:33,920 --> 0:19:38,240
that is complete boredom you're just tapping the bat on the ground I would feel bad for him

192
0:19:38,240 --> 0:19:44,240
except he's won 450 thousand dollars and he can leave whatever he wants so he'll be fine

193
0:19:45,200 --> 0:19:49,280
Alex hey we were watching on the cameras you looked very sad

194
0:19:50,480 --> 0:19:55,680
yeah I'm pretty bored well here's $10,000 so you less bored helps a little how many weeks

195
0:19:55,680 --> 0:20:01,120
left you got well you know if I got an hour left here let's go look at your sea of money over here

196
0:20:01,120 --> 0:20:05,520
this is all the money you've made so far 450 grand are you saying you're content with it

197
0:20:07,040 --> 0:20:10,240
give me one second I've got a surprise that might help you decide

198
0:20:14,880 --> 0:20:20,400
hey baby what the heck don't cry I didn't open

199
0:20:23,520 --> 0:20:24,640
why wear your shoes

200
0:20:26,640 --> 0:20:31,200
jimmy clear I didn't take his shoes I don't know why he's not wearing shoes these are all

201
0:20:31,200 --> 0:20:35,520
the things that this money's gonna go toward this crazy I can't even wrap my head around it I

202
0:20:35,520 --> 0:20:39,040
feel like I could do another five days you think it's worth it

203
0:20:39,040 --> 0:20:45,920
what's the verdict we've weighed the options make tons of money keep tons of money you already made

204
0:20:45,920 --> 0:20:50,960
honestly it's not worth staying in okay well then let's push the money out

205
0:20:56,160 --> 0:21:00,480
all right Alex the second you step on the red it's over I can move all the money back

206
0:21:00,480 --> 0:21:06,880
we can keep going it's your decision all right bring it back in okay bring it back in just

207
0:21:06,880 --> 0:21:15,360
kidding Alex spent 45 days in the store and walked away with 450 thousand dollars

208
0:21:15,360 --> 0:21:21,280
definitely this happened this is freaking sick congratulations Alex shout out to Albertson

209
0:21:21,280 --> 0:21:25,200
for helping us fill the shelves you guys were amazing I'm gonna go find a shirt also if you're

210
0:21:25,200 --> 0:21:28,640
wondering how we filmed this video because we blew up the earth earlier it was actually on the moon

211
0:21:28,640 --> 0:21:31,440
the entire time watch the laser maze video if that's confusing
