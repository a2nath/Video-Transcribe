1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:03,900
Sitting on these train tracks is a quarter-million-dollar Lamborghini,

2
0:00:03,900 --> 0:00:07,400
and barreling down on it right now is a massive train.

3
0:00:07,400 --> 0:00:10,400
But before the impact, I'm giving this Lamborghini to Blake.

4
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:10,900
Thank you.

5
0:00:10,900 --> 0:00:17,300
And on top of sending the train, I'm also gonna have these eight soldiers shoot 10,000 bullets at your Lamborghini.

6
0:00:17,300 --> 0:00:18,800
That's the scariest thing I've ever seen.

7
0:00:18,800 --> 0:00:20,000
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

8
0:00:20,000 --> 0:00:25,300
And you have exactly 24 hours to build whatever you want to protect your Lamborghini from the bullets.

9
0:00:25,300 --> 0:00:26,300
The timer starts now.

10
0:00:26,300 --> 0:00:29,900
Okay, first line of defense, I'm thinking a wall of cinder blocks.

11
0:00:29,900 --> 0:00:33,100
After that, some shipping containers filled with refrigerators.

12
0:00:33,100 --> 0:00:36,300
And then basically just a wall of cars to block those bullets.

13
0:00:36,300 --> 0:00:39,600
Do you think all of this is enough to stop 10,000 bullets?

14
0:00:39,600 --> 0:00:40,500
I think it is, Jimmy.

15
0:00:40,500 --> 0:00:42,300
Okay, but so far nothing's there.

16
0:00:42,300 --> 0:00:43,100
You should get the building.

17
0:00:43,100 --> 0:00:50,000
Blake immediately drove to three stores where I gave him my credit card and he literally spent $78,000 on supplies.

18
0:00:50,000 --> 0:00:53,600
And since I don't want to bore you with all that, let's just skip to the part when everything was delivered.

19
0:00:53,600 --> 0:00:55,700
His first round of supplies are starting to show up.

20
0:00:55,700 --> 0:00:58,900
Oh my god, I can't believe I bought all this stuff and this isn't even everything, man.

21
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:00,100
He's got a water truck.

22
0:01:00,100 --> 0:01:01,800
Some of his junk cars came in.

23
0:01:01,800 --> 0:01:03,700
He's got a convex crate over here.

24
0:01:03,700 --> 0:01:05,300
How do they eat this much stuff?

25
0:01:05,300 --> 0:01:06,300
This is crazy.

26
0:01:06,300 --> 0:01:08,300
Don't worry about the guys with the machine guns.

27
0:01:08,300 --> 0:01:09,700
Pretend they're not there.

28
0:01:09,700 --> 0:01:12,100
Yeah, I don't even know what they're doing there, honestly.

29
0:01:12,100 --> 0:01:17,400
We're five hours in and this storage container is about to be the first line of defense against 10,000 bullets.

30
0:01:17,400 --> 0:01:18,200
All right, that's probably good.

31
0:01:18,200 --> 0:01:20,000
That's probably good.

32
0:01:20,000 --> 0:01:22,500
Do you think that shipping container is gonna stop any bullets?

33
0:01:22,500 --> 0:01:25,000
Absolutely not.

34
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:26,200
So as of now, he's screwed.

35
0:01:26,200 --> 0:01:27,400
Yeah, he's not looking good for it.

36
0:01:27,400 --> 0:01:27,900
Oh gosh.

37
0:01:27,900 --> 0:01:29,200
It's been about six hours.

38
0:01:29,200 --> 0:01:30,500
Are you happy with your progress?

39
0:01:30,500 --> 0:01:31,700
I'm very happy.

40
0:01:31,700 --> 0:01:32,100
You sure?

41
0:01:32,100 --> 0:01:35,300
It wasn't until this thing got down, but now that it's down, dude, I feel really good.

42
0:01:35,300 --> 0:01:38,900
I asked him if this would stop the bullets and they said no.

43
0:01:38,900 --> 0:01:43,200
And once Blake realized he had to go all out, he worked not only through the night.

44
0:01:43,200 --> 0:01:45,100
This way, Mr. Rail wrote ties.

45
0:01:45,100 --> 0:01:46,900
Nice, nice, yes.

46
0:01:46,900 --> 0:01:48,100
Really nice, really nice.

47
0:01:48,100 --> 0:01:51,100
But even into the next morning, upgrading his defense.

48
0:01:51,100 --> 0:01:54,700
Dude, he's stuffing the storage container with a van and a giant tube.

49
0:01:54,700 --> 0:01:57,700
And once I saw it put together, I was honestly pretty impressed.

50
0:01:57,700 --> 0:01:59,100
Run me through what you built.

51
0:01:59,100 --> 0:02:00,900
So I built a whole bunch of concrete in the front.

52
0:02:00,900 --> 0:02:04,500
And the tallest part of the wall is right in the center to block the crow's nest machine guns

53
0:02:04,500 --> 0:02:06,000
because those things are big and scary.

54
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,600
I got all my storage containers and a bunch of water.

55
0:02:08,600 --> 0:02:14,100
And if you come right over here, you will see his Lamborghini tucked away amongst everything.

56
0:02:14,100 --> 0:02:15,400
There it is, nice and cozy.

57
0:02:15,400 --> 0:02:18,600
Do you think all of this will stop the bullets?

58
0:02:18,600 --> 0:02:19,400
Yeah, I do.

59
0:02:19,400 --> 0:02:21,700
I think you have a 50% chance of survival.

60
0:02:21,700 --> 0:02:23,300
It was the best odds I've had yet, so.

61
0:02:23,300 --> 0:02:26,900
And before I have them shoot 10,000 rounds, come with me to the Lamborghini.

62
0:02:26,900 --> 0:02:30,900
Not only are you competing for this Lamborghini, but for 100 grand as well.

63
0:02:30,900 --> 0:02:31,700
What?

64
0:02:31,700 --> 0:02:32,600
Yes, sir.

65
0:02:32,600 --> 0:02:33,400
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

66
0:02:33,400 --> 0:02:35,800
This will be enough to cover the insurance.

67
0:02:35,800 --> 0:02:37,500
24 hours is up.

68
0:02:37,500 --> 0:02:40,600
Eight scary men, 10,000 bullets.

69
0:02:40,600 --> 0:02:42,600
Versus everything that Blake has built.

70
0:02:42,600 --> 0:02:43,500
Are you ready?

71
0:02:43,500 --> 0:02:46,600
Just get it over with, freaking out.

72
0:02:46,600 --> 0:02:49,500
We're locked and loaded, ready to fire on you, Jimmy.

73
0:02:49,500 --> 0:02:51,300
Sir, fire at will.

74
0:02:51,300 --> 0:02:52,100
Roger that.

75
0:02:52,100 --> 0:02:53,600
Stand by!

76
0:02:53,600 --> 0:02:54,900
Fire!

77
0:02:55,900 --> 0:02:57,900
Oh my God.

78
0:02:57,900 --> 0:03:00,900
Oh, they are unloading on his horses.

79
0:03:00,900 --> 0:03:02,900
Oh my God, make them stop.

80
0:03:02,900 --> 0:03:03,900
Make them stop.

81
0:03:03,900 --> 0:03:06,900
They're actually ripping through the center box now.

82
0:03:08,900 --> 0:03:11,900
Oh man, oh God.

83
0:03:11,900 --> 0:03:13,900
Yo, Blake's walls are crumbling.

84
0:03:17,900 --> 0:03:24,400
And what we haven't told Blake is these guns are only the first of four phases we've designed to destroy this Lamborghini.

85
0:03:25,400 --> 0:03:28,400
Or should I say, whatever remains after this.

86
0:03:28,400 --> 0:03:30,400
They just brought out the LMG.

87
0:03:36,400 --> 0:03:37,400
Oh, whoa.

88
0:03:40,400 --> 0:03:41,400
Oh, this is filthy.

89
0:03:43,400 --> 0:03:44,400
No.

90
0:03:45,400 --> 0:03:47,400
They just locked our ball in.

91
0:03:47,400 --> 0:03:52,400
All it takes is one bullet to penetrate, and it's going in his Lambo.

92
0:03:53,400 --> 0:03:55,400
Oh my God.

93
0:04:00,400 --> 0:04:01,400
Is it a last bullet?

94
0:04:05,400 --> 0:04:06,400
All clear?

95
0:04:06,400 --> 0:04:07,400
Let's go.

96
0:04:07,400 --> 0:04:09,400
Oh God, please be safe, please be safe.

97
0:04:11,400 --> 0:04:12,400
How is it?

98
0:04:12,400 --> 0:04:14,400
She's clean, baby.

99
0:04:16,400 --> 0:04:19,400
Ten thousand rounds and not one connection, baby.

100
0:04:19,400 --> 0:04:21,400
No bull holes in your Lamborghini.

101
0:04:21,400 --> 0:04:26,400
And if you don't already know who Blake is, he's actually a contestant from two previous videos.

102
0:04:26,400 --> 0:04:30,400
But today he's back for a third and final attempt to win the grand prize.

103
0:04:30,400 --> 0:04:31,400
Are you ready for phase two?

104
0:04:31,400 --> 0:04:32,400
Yes.

105
0:04:32,400 --> 0:04:34,400
See that giant crane coming?

106
0:04:34,400 --> 0:04:36,400
That big yellow oil rig looking thing?

107
0:04:36,400 --> 0:04:37,400
That is phase two.

108
0:04:37,400 --> 0:04:44,400
That crane is going to lift your car up 100 feet and then in 24 hours drop it and you have to catch it without it being destroyed.

109
0:04:45,400 --> 0:04:46,400
Seriously?

110
0:04:46,400 --> 0:04:47,400
Yeah.

111
0:04:47,400 --> 0:04:48,400
All right, bring it over here.

112
0:04:48,400 --> 0:04:51,400
We prepared the world's first 100 foot Lamborghini free fall.

113
0:04:51,400 --> 0:04:53,400
There goes your Lamborghini, Blake.

114
0:04:53,400 --> 0:04:56,400
Blake began to strategize on how he was going to catch it.

115
0:04:56,400 --> 0:04:57,400
I have no idea what I'm going to do.

116
0:04:57,400 --> 0:04:58,400
Taylor, come over here.

117
0:04:58,400 --> 0:04:59,400
Yes, I'm here.

118
0:04:59,400 --> 0:05:00,400
How would you break its faults?

119
0:05:00,400 --> 0:05:01,400
You get all the pillows in the city.

120
0:05:01,400 --> 0:05:02,400
Step two.

121
0:05:02,400 --> 0:05:03,400
Get all the mattresses.

122
0:05:03,400 --> 0:05:04,400
Next, get a blanket.

123
0:05:04,400 --> 0:05:06,400
Taylor, you're just making a giant bed.

124
0:05:06,400 --> 0:05:07,400
Then a warm glass of milk.

125
0:05:07,400 --> 0:05:08,400
All right, stop.

126
0:05:08,400 --> 0:05:09,400
You're not helping.

127
0:05:09,400 --> 0:05:10,400
Blake, work your magic.

128
0:05:10,400 --> 0:05:11,400
I'm screwed.

129
0:05:11,400 --> 0:05:12,400
All right, guys.

130
0:05:12,400 --> 0:05:13,400
I got some good news and bad news.

131
0:05:13,400 --> 0:05:15,400
We passed day one with flying colors.

132
0:05:15,400 --> 0:05:17,400
The bad news is the Lamborghini is airborne.

133
0:05:17,400 --> 0:05:18,400
Okay.

134
0:05:18,400 --> 0:05:20,400
So anyone got any ideas?

135
0:05:20,400 --> 0:05:22,400
I mean, what do we think?

136
0:05:22,400 --> 0:05:23,400
The bouncy castles?

137
0:05:23,400 --> 0:05:24,400
Bouncy castles.

138
0:05:24,400 --> 0:05:28,400
That's actually not that bad just because that's not bad at all, really.

139
0:05:28,400 --> 0:05:31,400
And after being inspired by the construction worker's wisdom,

140
0:05:31,400 --> 0:05:33,400
Blake had decided on his master plan.

141
0:05:33,400 --> 0:05:36,400
I would like to move the con-exes in like a square right here

142
0:05:36,400 --> 0:05:37,400
with the X in the middle

143
0:05:37,400 --> 0:05:40,400
and that way I can just fill the square up with a bunch of air mattresses,

144
0:05:40,400 --> 0:05:44,400
pillows, bubble wrap, and I'll top it all off with a bunch of bouncy castles.

145
0:05:44,400 --> 0:05:47,400
Just, you know, the biggest problem right now is I have no material.

146
0:05:47,400 --> 0:05:50,400
Everything that I bought is hard, concrete, or metal

147
0:05:50,400 --> 0:05:54,400
and nothing that I bought I can use for day two, so I have absolutely nothing.

148
0:05:54,400 --> 0:05:57,400
And so Blake sent his crew to buy every pillow and air mattress in the city

149
0:05:57,400 --> 0:06:00,400
and even though he was incredibly sleep deprived, he got to work.

150
0:06:00,400 --> 0:06:02,400
I'm already at the stage where it's like,

151
0:06:02,400 --> 0:06:03,400
wait, why am I doing this again?

152
0:06:03,400 --> 0:06:04,400
Oh, yeah, that's right.

153
0:06:04,400 --> 0:06:07,400
I'm in a challenge for a Lamborghini that's floating in the sky right now.

154
0:06:07,400 --> 0:06:09,400
By the time his materials had arrived,

155
0:06:09,400 --> 0:06:11,400
Blake had been awake for over 24 hours.

156
0:06:11,400 --> 0:06:13,400
It was in desperate need of sleep.

157
0:06:13,400 --> 0:06:15,400
I'm going to try to get some sleep because I'm exhausted

158
0:06:15,400 --> 0:06:16,400
and it's four in the morning.

159
0:06:16,400 --> 0:06:18,400
And with how exhausted Blake was,

160
0:06:18,400 --> 0:06:21,400
he ended up sleeping for way longer than he planned.

161
0:06:22,400 --> 0:06:23,400
Blake!

162
0:06:24,400 --> 0:06:25,400
Is he serious?

163
0:06:25,400 --> 0:06:26,400
What is this?

164
0:06:26,400 --> 0:06:28,400
He got mattresses, pillows, and blankets,

165
0:06:28,400 --> 0:06:29,400
but he's missing the warm milk.

166
0:06:29,400 --> 0:06:31,400
Yeah, that's the key to everything.

167
0:06:31,400 --> 0:06:32,400
Where is Blake?

168
0:06:32,400 --> 0:06:33,400
He's asleep, I heard.

169
0:06:33,400 --> 0:06:34,400
No, he's not.

170
0:06:34,400 --> 0:06:36,400
By the time Blake got on site,

171
0:06:36,400 --> 0:06:38,400
he was already super late in the day.

172
0:06:38,400 --> 0:06:40,400
That's Blake's truck pulling up.

173
0:06:40,400 --> 0:06:41,400
Hey, we need to get to work.

174
0:06:41,400 --> 0:06:42,400
Come on.

175
0:06:42,400 --> 0:06:43,400
Let's just see what this looks like.

176
0:06:44,400 --> 0:06:46,400
That bouncy house works as a big box.

177
0:06:46,400 --> 0:06:49,400
So I'm thinking maybe we put that thing in the middle now

178
0:06:49,400 --> 0:06:50,400
and then we start blowing it up.

179
0:06:50,400 --> 0:06:52,400
Only four and a half hours remain

180
0:06:52,400 --> 0:06:54,400
and it's not looking good for Blake.

181
0:06:54,400 --> 0:06:57,400
I don't think he has more than a 10% chance of catching a Lamborghini.

182
0:06:57,400 --> 0:06:58,400
And even if he does,

183
0:06:58,400 --> 0:07:00,400
there's no shot he's stopping that train later on.

184
0:07:00,400 --> 0:07:03,400
Start filling up the side so that way it's high over here.

185
0:07:03,400 --> 0:07:04,400
It takes away this wall.

186
0:07:04,400 --> 0:07:06,400
So it's only a couple of hours remaining.

187
0:07:06,400 --> 0:07:09,400
Blake did all that he could by filling the rest of his pit

188
0:07:09,400 --> 0:07:11,400
with cardboard boxes and bubble wrap.

189
0:07:11,400 --> 0:07:12,400
It's coming down to the wire.

190
0:07:12,400 --> 0:07:14,400
Taylor, how much time is left?

191
0:07:15,400 --> 0:07:16,400
One hour.

192
0:07:16,400 --> 0:07:17,400
Blake is screwed.

193
0:07:17,400 --> 0:07:18,400
I have a little bit of bubble wrap left.

194
0:07:18,400 --> 0:07:20,400
I think I'm just going to get raised on this thing

195
0:07:20,400 --> 0:07:22,400
and just wrap my baby up in this bubble wrap and I'm good to go.

196
0:07:22,400 --> 0:07:23,400
That's definitely going to help.

197
0:07:23,400 --> 0:07:26,400
Blake spent what little time he had remaining on this crane

198
0:07:26,400 --> 0:07:29,400
failing at trying to bubble wrap his car.

199
0:07:29,400 --> 0:07:30,400
It's just not going to work.

200
0:07:30,400 --> 0:07:31,400
You know what time it is?

201
0:07:31,400 --> 0:07:32,400
What?

202
0:07:32,400 --> 0:07:33,400
Time to drop the car.

203
0:07:33,400 --> 0:07:35,400
Let's drop this rat boy.

204
0:07:36,400 --> 0:07:39,400
The failed bubble wrap makes it look majestic.

205
0:07:39,400 --> 0:07:41,400
Blake, do you think your Lamborghini will survive?

206
0:07:41,400 --> 0:07:42,400
I'm positive, Jimmy.

207
0:07:42,400 --> 0:07:44,400
He's more certain than me.

208
0:07:44,400 --> 0:07:45,400
I'm positive about this one.

209
0:07:45,400 --> 0:07:47,400
I bought every air mattress at Walmart.

210
0:07:47,400 --> 0:07:49,400
If this won't catch you, I don't know what will.

211
0:07:49,400 --> 0:07:50,400
I did everything I can.

212
0:07:50,400 --> 0:07:51,400
Here's a few swirls, Mark Blake.

213
0:07:51,400 --> 0:07:52,400
Thank you, Mr. Jimmy.

214
0:07:52,400 --> 0:07:54,400
That way, even if you lose the car,

215
0:07:54,400 --> 0:07:55,400
at least you have some good chocolate.

216
0:07:55,400 --> 0:07:56,400
It's available at Walmart.

217
0:07:56,400 --> 0:07:58,400
Be sure to go try our new chocolate bar.

218
0:07:58,400 --> 0:07:59,400
I'm so curious what you think.

219
0:07:59,400 --> 0:08:01,400
But anyways, you have three bouncy castles,

220
0:08:01,400 --> 0:08:03,400
150 mattresses.

221
0:08:03,400 --> 0:08:04,400
How many pillows?

222
0:08:04,400 --> 0:08:05,400
150.

223
0:08:05,400 --> 0:08:08,400
150 pillows and 2,000 cardboard boxes

224
0:08:08,400 --> 0:08:10,400
will it break the Lamborghini's fall?

225
0:08:10,400 --> 0:08:11,400
Yes.

226
0:08:11,400 --> 0:08:12,400
Yes.

227
0:08:12,400 --> 0:08:13,400
That's two yeses.

228
0:08:13,400 --> 0:08:14,400
Okay.

229
0:08:14,400 --> 0:08:15,400
24 hours of work.

230
0:08:15,400 --> 0:08:16,400
Down to this.

231
0:08:16,400 --> 0:08:17,400
No pun intended.

232
0:08:17,400 --> 0:08:19,400
Three, two, one.

233
0:08:19,400 --> 0:08:21,400
Drop the Lamborghini.

234
0:08:34,400 --> 0:08:35,400
No, no, no.

235
0:08:35,400 --> 0:08:36,400
Out of my way.

236
0:08:36,400 --> 0:08:37,400
That did not sound good.

237
0:08:37,400 --> 0:08:38,400
Okay, please be okay.

238
0:08:38,400 --> 0:08:39,400
Please be okay.

239
0:08:39,400 --> 0:08:41,400
All right, he's moving the counter straight out the way.

240
0:08:41,400 --> 0:08:43,400
There's no way you got that lamp on.

241
0:08:43,400 --> 0:08:45,400
Get these boxes out of the way.

242
0:08:45,400 --> 0:08:46,400
What?

243
0:08:46,400 --> 0:08:48,400
We're about to find out how damaged this car is.

244
0:08:48,400 --> 0:08:49,400
The lights work.

245
0:08:49,400 --> 0:08:50,400
The lights work.

246
0:08:50,400 --> 0:08:53,400
Yeah, this princess castle might just save this entire car.

247
0:08:53,400 --> 0:08:54,400
Open up truth.

248
0:08:54,400 --> 0:08:56,400
You might have been the first person in history

249
0:08:56,400 --> 0:08:58,400
to catch a Lamborghini.

250
0:08:58,400 --> 0:08:59,400
If it turns on.

251
0:08:59,400 --> 0:09:00,400
All right, here we go.

252
0:09:00,400 --> 0:09:01,400
Here we go.

253
0:09:04,400 --> 0:09:05,400
It works.

254
0:09:05,400 --> 0:09:06,400
I can't believe it.

255
0:09:07,400 --> 0:09:09,400
That's what I'm talking about.

256
0:09:09,400 --> 0:09:10,400
She's alive.

257
0:09:10,400 --> 0:09:12,400
Everything looks good.

258
0:09:12,400 --> 0:09:14,400
Mind it's a little crack in the bumper.

259
0:09:14,400 --> 0:09:16,400
Which we found out by this official appraiser.

260
0:09:16,400 --> 0:09:19,400
This was only going to reduce the price of Blake's Lamborghini

261
0:09:19,400 --> 0:09:20,400
by probably 10 grand.

262
0:09:20,400 --> 0:09:21,400
Thank you so much.

263
0:09:21,400 --> 0:09:22,400
Thanks for the good news.

264
0:09:22,400 --> 0:09:24,400
And now it's the perfect time to mention

265
0:09:24,400 --> 0:09:27,400
that phase three is Flaming Cars.

266
0:09:27,400 --> 0:09:29,400
For Blake's next challenge,

267
0:09:29,400 --> 0:09:31,400
we're bringing back his biggest nightmare.

268
0:09:31,400 --> 0:09:34,400
We have recreated the Flaming Cars challenge

269
0:09:34,400 --> 0:09:36,400
that cost Blake everything last time.

270
0:09:36,400 --> 0:09:37,400
Wow.

271
0:09:37,400 --> 0:09:38,400
That's a low blow job.

272
0:09:38,400 --> 0:09:40,400
But seeing how he's done this before,

273
0:09:40,400 --> 0:09:44,400
we're going to up the stage by dropping twice as many cars as last time.

274
0:09:44,400 --> 0:09:45,400
I'll see you tomorrow.

275
0:09:45,400 --> 0:09:46,400
I got a lot to prove.

276
0:09:46,400 --> 0:09:47,400
Redemption Day!

277
0:09:47,400 --> 0:09:51,400
Blake spent the rest of the night disassembling his defense for phase two.

278
0:09:51,400 --> 0:09:52,400
And after a good night of sleep,

279
0:09:52,400 --> 0:09:55,400
he was ready to begin his defense for phase three.

280
0:09:55,400 --> 0:09:57,400
Stay in the morning, just woke up.

281
0:09:57,400 --> 0:09:59,400
We got a lot of work to do today, so let's get started.

282
0:09:59,400 --> 0:10:01,400
Here's the day three plan.

283
0:10:01,400 --> 0:10:03,400
I'm going to cut the bottom out of a shipping container

284
0:10:03,400 --> 0:10:05,400
and I'm going to drop it right on the car.

285
0:10:05,400 --> 0:10:07,400
Next, I'm going to take two more containers

286
0:10:07,400 --> 0:10:08,400
and I'm going to lean them up,

287
0:10:08,400 --> 0:10:10,400
come into a point right above the car.

288
0:10:10,400 --> 0:10:13,400
And most importantly, nothing flammable this time.

289
0:10:13,400 --> 0:10:14,400
Do you think that'll deflate the car?

290
0:10:14,400 --> 0:10:15,400
Yes, sir.

291
0:10:15,400 --> 0:10:16,400
Oh, I thought you were going to say no.

292
0:10:16,400 --> 0:10:18,400
Blake then asked his crew to remove

293
0:10:18,400 --> 0:10:20,400
every piece of wood that was in the container,

294
0:10:20,400 --> 0:10:23,400
because that's what ended his challenge last time.

295
0:10:23,400 --> 0:10:25,400
He then had them cut out the bottom of the container

296
0:10:25,400 --> 0:10:27,400
that would surround the Lamborghini.

297
0:10:27,400 --> 0:10:29,400
The storage container could put a lot of damage.

298
0:10:29,400 --> 0:10:30,400
Will you crush it?

299
0:10:30,400 --> 0:10:31,400
Yeah.

300
0:10:31,400 --> 0:10:32,400
You can?

301
0:10:32,400 --> 0:10:35,400
I mean, yeah, I think it weighs a whole lot.

302
0:10:35,400 --> 0:10:36,400
And with that being done,

303
0:10:36,400 --> 0:10:38,400
Blake just needs to lower the container carefully

304
0:10:38,400 --> 0:10:41,400
over the Lamborghini without damaging.

305
0:10:41,400 --> 0:10:42,400
Want to scratch your costume?

306
0:10:42,400 --> 0:10:43,400
Thousands of dollars.

307
0:10:43,400 --> 0:10:44,400
You're good, just like that.

308
0:10:44,400 --> 0:10:46,400
It is so close to scraping the car.

309
0:10:46,400 --> 0:10:47,400
Watch your fingers.

310
0:10:47,400 --> 0:10:50,400
We're coming down.

311
0:10:50,400 --> 0:10:51,400
Yes!

312
0:10:51,400 --> 0:10:52,400
Yes!

313
0:10:52,400 --> 0:10:53,400
I cannot believe that.

314
0:10:53,400 --> 0:10:54,400
All right.

315
0:10:54,400 --> 0:10:55,400
Next, we're going to bring these containers together

316
0:10:55,400 --> 0:10:56,400
to form a V.

317
0:10:56,400 --> 0:10:57,400
What if the car gets caught in there?

318
0:10:57,400 --> 0:10:59,400
Yeah, that can't happen, dude.

319
0:10:59,400 --> 0:11:01,400
That's why we're putting this pointy thing at the top.

320
0:11:01,400 --> 0:11:04,400
Do you think that will actually deflect their car?

321
0:11:04,400 --> 0:11:05,400
100%.

322
0:11:05,400 --> 0:11:06,400
20 minutes remain

323
0:11:06,400 --> 0:11:08,400
and then we see if that Lamborghini perishes

324
0:11:08,400 --> 0:11:10,400
just like his 500 grand.

325
0:11:10,400 --> 0:11:14,400
And as usual, Blake utilized every last second.

326
0:11:14,400 --> 0:11:16,400
Three, two, one.

327
0:11:16,400 --> 0:11:19,400
Not quite sure what that dirt accomplished.

328
0:11:19,400 --> 0:11:20,400
Time is up.

329
0:11:20,400 --> 0:11:21,400
No.

330
0:11:21,400 --> 0:11:23,400
Let's see if, unlike last time,

331
0:11:23,400 --> 0:11:25,400
you survived phase three.

332
0:11:25,400 --> 0:11:27,400
Redemption.

333
0:11:27,400 --> 0:11:30,400
Blake, you lost $500,000

334
0:11:30,400 --> 0:11:32,400
from this exact challenge.

335
0:11:32,400 --> 0:11:33,400
How are you feeling?

336
0:11:33,400 --> 0:11:34,400
I feel pretty confident.

337
0:11:34,400 --> 0:11:36,400
I think the viewers want to know one thing.

338
0:11:36,400 --> 0:11:38,400
Did you put wood inside of there like last time?

339
0:11:38,400 --> 0:11:39,400
A little bit.

340
0:11:39,400 --> 0:11:40,400
Nah, I'm just kidding.

341
0:11:40,400 --> 0:11:41,400
There's no wood in there.

342
0:11:41,400 --> 0:11:42,400
It was one of the biggest mistakes

343
0:11:42,400 --> 0:11:43,400
I've ever made in my life.

344
0:11:43,400 --> 0:11:45,400
Moment of truth.

345
0:11:45,400 --> 0:11:46,400
Come on in.

346
0:11:46,400 --> 0:11:47,400
Three shipping containers,

347
0:11:47,400 --> 0:11:48,400
a bunch of dirt,

348
0:11:48,400 --> 0:11:49,400
concrete,

349
0:11:49,400 --> 0:11:52,400
a weird like pointed roof thing,

350
0:11:52,400 --> 0:11:54,400
versus 10 flaming cars.

351
0:11:54,400 --> 0:11:55,400
Are you ready?

352
0:11:55,400 --> 0:11:56,400
Let's go, dude.

353
0:11:56,400 --> 0:11:58,400
Light it on fire!

354
0:11:58,400 --> 0:12:00,400
Will Blake be one step closer

355
0:12:00,400 --> 0:12:03,400
to going home with a brand new Lamborghini

356
0:12:03,400 --> 0:12:06,400
filled with $100,000

357
0:12:06,400 --> 0:12:07,400
or be eliminated

358
0:12:07,400 --> 0:12:09,400
and go home with nothing?

359
0:12:09,400 --> 0:12:11,400
We're about to find out.

360
0:12:11,400 --> 0:12:14,400
Three, two, one.

361
0:12:14,400 --> 0:12:16,400
Drop it!

362
0:12:16,400 --> 0:12:18,400
Oh!

363
0:12:18,400 --> 0:12:19,400
Oh.

364
0:12:19,400 --> 0:12:20,400
Oh.

365
0:12:20,400 --> 0:12:21,400
Oh, you did not want that.

366
0:12:21,400 --> 0:12:22,400
I feel like that's exactly

367
0:12:22,400 --> 0:12:24,400
what he didn't want to happen.

368
0:12:24,400 --> 0:12:26,400
Oh, no.

369
0:12:26,400 --> 0:12:28,400
You still feeling good?

370
0:12:28,400 --> 0:12:29,400
Not as good yet.

371
0:12:29,400 --> 0:12:31,400
This is giving me some flashbacks.

372
0:12:31,400 --> 0:12:32,400
It's giving you some flashbacks.

373
0:12:32,400 --> 0:12:33,400
All right.

374
0:12:33,400 --> 0:12:34,400
Ready for the next one?

375
0:12:34,400 --> 0:12:35,400
Just do it.

376
0:12:35,400 --> 0:12:36,400
Just do it.

377
0:12:36,400 --> 0:12:38,400
Drop it!

378
0:12:38,400 --> 0:12:39,400
Oh, my God!

379
0:12:39,400 --> 0:12:41,400
The roof looks like it's already buckling!

380
0:12:41,400 --> 0:12:43,400
And just in case Blake loses

381
0:12:43,400 --> 0:12:45,400
to the flaming cars like last time,

382
0:12:45,400 --> 0:12:46,400
I'm going to take this moment

383
0:12:46,400 --> 0:12:48,400
and tell you about this amazing new phone.

384
0:12:48,400 --> 0:12:49,400
What you're currently watching on

385
0:12:49,400 --> 0:12:52,400
is the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.

386
0:12:52,400 --> 0:12:55,400
This phone can record slow-mo and 4K.

387
0:12:55,400 --> 0:12:56,400
The camera on this is crazy.

388
0:12:56,400 --> 0:12:59,400
We're like 200 feet away in its nighttime

389
0:12:59,400 --> 0:13:01,400
and look at how crystal clear it is.

390
0:13:01,400 --> 0:13:02,400
Oh!

391
0:13:02,400 --> 0:13:05,400
And go ahead and drop it.

392
0:13:05,400 --> 0:13:06,400
Oh!

393
0:13:06,400 --> 0:13:07,400
Oh!

394
0:13:07,400 --> 0:13:08,400
Oh, that hurt to watch.

395
0:13:08,400 --> 0:13:10,400
It also has a ton of new features

396
0:13:10,400 --> 0:13:11,400
with Galaxy AI,

397
0:13:11,400 --> 0:13:14,400
like photo assist.

398
0:13:14,400 --> 0:13:15,400
Remember the last challenge

399
0:13:15,400 --> 0:13:17,400
when the bumper got cracked on the Lambo?

400
0:13:17,400 --> 0:13:19,400
You can just circle it like this

401
0:13:19,400 --> 0:13:21,400
and all you do is you hit that eraser button.

402
0:13:21,400 --> 0:13:22,400
And just like that,

403
0:13:22,400 --> 0:13:23,400
the bumper is fixed.

404
0:13:23,400 --> 0:13:24,400
Now I have a new car.

405
0:13:24,400 --> 0:13:26,400
For the picture you do.

406
0:13:26,400 --> 0:13:28,400
Whatever you're ready.

407
0:13:31,400 --> 0:13:34,400
This phone also has circle to search with Google,

408
0:13:34,400 --> 0:13:37,400
which makes finding information incredibly easy.

409
0:13:37,400 --> 0:13:39,400
It would have helped Blake a lot in the last video

410
0:13:39,400 --> 0:13:41,400
to learn about the flammability of wood

411
0:13:41,400 --> 0:13:42,400
and railroad tides.

412
0:13:42,400 --> 0:13:44,400
All he needed to do was long press the home button,

413
0:13:44,400 --> 0:13:46,400
circle the railroad tides,

414
0:13:46,400 --> 0:13:47,400
and ask,

415
0:13:47,400 --> 0:13:49,400
is this flammable?

416
0:13:49,400 --> 0:13:50,400
As you can see,

417
0:13:50,400 --> 0:13:52,400
railroad tides are flammable.

418
0:13:52,400 --> 0:13:54,400
He would have learned the answers instantly.

419
0:13:54,400 --> 0:13:55,400
I just told you.

420
0:13:57,400 --> 0:13:59,400
I was genuinely impressed by this phone,

421
0:13:59,400 --> 0:14:01,400
and I think you will be too.

422
0:14:01,400 --> 0:14:02,400
So, go to Samsung.com,

423
0:14:02,400 --> 0:14:03,400
click the link in the description

424
0:14:03,400 --> 0:14:04,400
or scan this QR code

425
0:14:04,400 --> 0:14:05,400
to check it out right now.

426
0:14:05,400 --> 0:14:07,400
And let's drop the next car.

427
0:14:10,400 --> 0:14:12,400
We drop car after car.

428
0:14:12,400 --> 0:14:13,400
And with each one,

429
0:14:13,400 --> 0:14:15,400
we could tell Blake was getting nervous.

430
0:14:15,400 --> 0:14:16,400
But we also noticed

431
0:14:16,400 --> 0:14:17,400
that all of the impacts

432
0:14:17,400 --> 0:14:20,400
were starting to damage the crate itself.

433
0:14:20,400 --> 0:14:22,400
Your crate on the bottom is bowing.

434
0:14:22,400 --> 0:14:23,400
At this point,

435
0:14:23,400 --> 0:14:25,400
the container protecting the Lamborghini

436
0:14:25,400 --> 0:14:27,400
was being crushed by the weight

437
0:14:27,400 --> 0:14:29,400
and heat of the cars.

438
0:14:29,400 --> 0:14:30,400
What about this every day

439
0:14:30,400 --> 0:14:31,400
since the last time I saw this?

440
0:14:31,400 --> 0:14:33,400
And now it's time for the final car!

441
0:14:35,400 --> 0:14:36,400
Yes!

442
0:14:36,400 --> 0:14:37,400
Fall!

443
0:14:37,400 --> 0:14:38,400
Fall!

444
0:14:38,400 --> 0:14:39,400
Oh, no.

445
0:14:39,400 --> 0:14:41,400
Bro, it's got to be a thousand degrees in there.

446
0:14:41,400 --> 0:14:43,400
His car has to be melting now.

447
0:14:43,400 --> 0:14:44,400
We got the fire extinguisher.

448
0:14:44,400 --> 0:14:46,400
Somehow he's running so fast.

449
0:14:46,400 --> 0:14:48,400
Be careful, Blake.

450
0:14:48,400 --> 0:14:49,400
I'm coming.

451
0:14:50,400 --> 0:14:52,400
How is it?

452
0:14:52,400 --> 0:14:53,400
It's okay.

453
0:14:53,400 --> 0:14:55,400
It's okay.

454
0:14:55,400 --> 0:14:56,400
Yes!

455
0:14:56,400 --> 0:14:58,400
You like that!

456
0:14:58,400 --> 0:15:00,400
If one more car was dropped,

457
0:15:00,400 --> 0:15:01,400
this crate would have collapsed.

458
0:15:01,400 --> 0:15:03,400
You stopped 10,000 bullets.

459
0:15:03,400 --> 0:15:04,400
Easy.

460
0:15:04,400 --> 0:15:06,400
You caught a car out of midair.

461
0:15:06,400 --> 0:15:09,400
You now deflected 10 flaming cars.

462
0:15:09,400 --> 0:15:11,400
And now it's time for phase four.

463
0:15:11,400 --> 0:15:12,400
Bring on the train.

464
0:15:12,400 --> 0:15:14,400
The timer has officially started.

465
0:15:14,400 --> 0:15:16,400
I gotta go.

466
0:15:16,400 --> 0:15:17,400
Good luck on phase four.

467
0:15:17,400 --> 0:15:18,400
Godspeed.

468
0:15:18,400 --> 0:15:19,400
What is he even running at?

469
0:15:19,400 --> 0:15:23,400
Blake knew that the train was going to be the most deadly attack yet,

470
0:15:23,400 --> 0:15:26,400
so he wasted no time in getting started.

471
0:15:26,400 --> 0:15:28,400
I think the best way to stop a train is to derail it.

472
0:15:28,400 --> 0:15:30,400
That's what I've tried to go to here.

473
0:15:30,400 --> 0:15:32,400
All these railroad ties are tucked snug,

474
0:15:32,400 --> 0:15:34,400
and all of these are going to go under the train

475
0:15:34,400 --> 0:15:36,400
and the train's going to hit them like that.

476
0:15:36,400 --> 0:15:38,400
And if I do that a hundred more times,

477
0:15:38,400 --> 0:15:40,400
I don't see the train just blowing past all that.

478
0:15:40,400 --> 0:15:43,400
The railroad ties lost me the challenge last video.

479
0:15:43,400 --> 0:15:44,400
This time they'll save me.

480
0:15:44,400 --> 0:15:46,400
I just need two inches off the track and I win.

481
0:15:46,400 --> 0:15:48,400
Two inches is a lot, though.

482
0:15:48,400 --> 0:15:49,400
My man.

483
0:15:49,400 --> 0:15:50,400
Then once I have all this done,

484
0:15:50,400 --> 0:15:52,400
I can just put concrete on top.

485
0:15:52,400 --> 0:15:53,400
I think that's going to work, man.

486
0:15:53,400 --> 0:15:54,400
I think that's going to work.

487
0:15:54,400 --> 0:15:57,400
Blake worked with his crew throughout the entire night.

488
0:15:57,400 --> 0:15:58,400
And when I showed up the next morning,

489
0:15:58,400 --> 0:16:01,400
it was obvious that the challenge had taken a toll on him.

490
0:16:01,400 --> 0:16:02,400
What's up, Jimbo?

491
0:16:02,400 --> 0:16:04,400
What happened to your voice?

492
0:16:04,400 --> 0:16:05,400
I'm like dying out here.

493
0:16:05,400 --> 0:16:08,400
As you guys know, he lost $250,000 in this video.

494
0:16:08,400 --> 0:16:10,400
He lost half a million dollars in this video.

495
0:16:10,400 --> 0:16:12,400
I think Blake is sick and tired of losing.

496
0:16:12,400 --> 0:16:14,400
He has an army going super hard.

497
0:16:14,400 --> 0:16:16,400
They're currently stacking the cars

498
0:16:16,400 --> 0:16:19,400
that we dropped on phase three on the train tracks.

499
0:16:19,400 --> 0:16:21,400
But time was still ticking down.

500
0:16:21,400 --> 0:16:24,400
And in order to stop this train and take his Lambo home,

501
0:16:24,400 --> 0:16:27,400
Blake began adding a lot more objects to the tracks.

502
0:16:27,400 --> 0:16:28,400
Like shipping containers.

503
0:16:28,400 --> 0:16:30,400
Mattresses to cushion the impact.

504
0:16:30,400 --> 0:16:32,400
Blake's worked so hard.

505
0:16:32,400 --> 0:16:33,400
I'm now on his team.

506
0:16:33,400 --> 0:16:34,400
And water tanks.

507
0:16:34,400 --> 0:16:35,400
Blake really seems to nobody's doing it.

508
0:16:35,400 --> 0:16:37,400
Too bad there's only 11 minutes left.

509
0:16:37,400 --> 0:16:39,400
At this point, Blake did everything he could

510
0:16:39,400 --> 0:16:41,400
to finish his build before time ran out.

511
0:16:41,400 --> 0:16:44,400
And it was actually starting to look impressive.

512
0:16:44,400 --> 0:16:45,400
This is it.

513
0:16:45,400 --> 0:16:47,400
The final stretch.

514
0:16:47,400 --> 0:16:48,400
Two.

515
0:16:48,400 --> 0:16:49,400
One.

516
0:16:49,400 --> 0:16:50,400
Last line of defense.

517
0:16:50,400 --> 0:16:51,400
Time's up.

518
0:16:51,400 --> 0:16:52,400
Stop.

519
0:16:52,400 --> 0:16:53,400
Turn it off.

520
0:16:53,400 --> 0:16:54,400
Turn it off.

521
0:16:54,400 --> 0:16:55,400
Time is officially up.

522
0:16:55,400 --> 0:16:56,400
Oh my God.

523
0:16:56,400 --> 0:16:57,400
From phase one's shipping containers,

524
0:16:57,400 --> 0:16:58,400
phase two's mattresses,

525
0:16:58,400 --> 0:17:00,400
and even phase three's burning cars,

526
0:17:00,400 --> 0:17:03,400
you somehow use all the resources from the previous phases.

527
0:17:03,400 --> 0:17:06,400
Let's see if you're driving home in a Lamborghini

528
0:17:06,400 --> 0:17:08,400
or if I'm dropping you off at your house.

529
0:17:08,400 --> 0:17:09,400
Bring that train on, man.

530
0:17:09,400 --> 0:17:10,400
Bring it on.

531
0:17:10,400 --> 0:17:11,400
Before we ram everything,

532
0:17:11,400 --> 0:17:13,400
we need to back the train up.

533
0:17:13,400 --> 0:17:15,400
We're gonna go really far back,

534
0:17:15,400 --> 0:17:17,400
knowing the train can pick up a lot of speed

535
0:17:17,400 --> 0:17:18,400
before it hits everything.

536
0:17:18,400 --> 0:17:19,400
Sound like a good idea?

537
0:17:19,400 --> 0:17:20,400
No, Jimmy.

538
0:17:20,400 --> 0:17:21,400
That sounds awful.

539
0:17:21,400 --> 0:17:22,400
Be honest.

540
0:17:22,400 --> 0:17:23,400
Do you think your Lamborghini will survive?

541
0:17:23,400 --> 0:17:24,400
God, I hope so, Jimmy.

542
0:17:24,400 --> 0:17:25,400
And of course,

543
0:17:25,400 --> 0:17:27,400
we have to put the feastables logo on the train.

544
0:17:27,400 --> 0:17:29,400
The new formula is the best chocolate on earth.

545
0:17:29,400 --> 0:17:31,400
Do yourself a favor and go give it a try.

546
0:17:31,400 --> 0:17:32,400
But for now,

547
0:17:32,400 --> 0:17:34,400
it's time for the biggest moment of Blake's life.

548
0:17:34,400 --> 0:17:36,400
Let's see if he wins a Lamborghini.

549
0:17:36,400 --> 0:17:37,400
Blake, any last words?

550
0:17:37,400 --> 0:17:38,400
Give it all you got.

551
0:17:38,400 --> 0:17:40,400
Send the train.

552
0:17:40,400 --> 0:17:41,400
Here it comes.

553
0:17:41,400 --> 0:17:42,400
Oh my God.

554
0:17:42,400 --> 0:17:43,400
Oh my God.

555
0:17:43,400 --> 0:17:44,400
It's coming.

556
0:17:44,400 --> 0:17:45,400
It's gonna speed up

557
0:17:45,400 --> 0:17:47,400
until it hits 35 miles an hour.

558
0:17:47,400 --> 0:17:48,400
Right before impact.

559
0:17:48,400 --> 0:17:49,400
Dude, it is going quick.

560
0:17:49,400 --> 0:17:50,400
It's just gonna derail.

561
0:17:50,400 --> 0:17:51,400
It's just gonna derail.

562
0:17:51,400 --> 0:17:52,400
Here she comes.

563
0:17:52,400 --> 0:17:54,400
Let's see if it's all working.

564
0:17:55,400 --> 0:18:01,400
Oh, wait.

565
0:18:01,400 --> 0:18:02,400
Wait, wait, wait.

566
0:18:02,400 --> 0:18:03,400
No, it derailed.

567
0:18:03,400 --> 0:18:05,400
Wait, I think it stopped.

568
0:18:05,400 --> 0:18:06,400
Oh my God.

569
0:18:06,400 --> 0:18:09,400
Blake, I've never seen something like this.

570
0:18:09,400 --> 0:18:10,400
Oh my God.

571
0:18:10,400 --> 0:18:11,400
