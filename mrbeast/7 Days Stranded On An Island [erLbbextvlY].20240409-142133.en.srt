1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:03,800
We are now stranded on this deserted island in the middle of the ocean!

2
0:00:03,800 --> 0:00:06,640
And we're gonna be stranded here for the next seven days!

3
0:00:06,640 --> 0:00:09,520
And that boat that just left was our only way out of here.

4
0:00:09,520 --> 0:00:10,920
Why do we keep doing this?

5
0:00:10,920 --> 0:00:11,840
I thought it'd be fun!

6
0:00:11,840 --> 0:00:18,160
Despite its beauty, civilization has not been able to survive on this island for over 250 years.

7
0:00:18,160 --> 0:00:20,680
But for the next seven days, we're gonna try to.

8
0:00:20,680 --> 0:00:22,920
And we only have around four hours until it gets dark!

9
0:00:22,920 --> 0:00:23,840
It's hot out here.

10
0:00:23,840 --> 0:00:25,320
We need to build a shelter immediately.

11
0:00:25,320 --> 0:00:28,160
I mean, why don't we just camp here? This spot looks pretty good.

12
0:00:28,240 --> 0:00:33,280
So, I say we kick things off by us going and looking for wood, and you two...

13
0:00:33,280 --> 0:00:34,440
We'll prep camp.

14
0:00:34,440 --> 0:00:35,040
Yes!

15
0:00:35,040 --> 0:00:37,320
Have fun with that. Come on, Sean. Come on, Chandler.

16
0:00:37,320 --> 0:00:38,200
How do we prep camp?

17
0:00:38,200 --> 0:00:38,840
You know, I don't know.

18
0:00:38,840 --> 0:00:42,560
And so we immediately got to work, but we had to be careful because...

19
0:00:42,560 --> 0:00:45,040
Above you is the most dangerous tree on Earth.

20
0:00:45,040 --> 0:00:49,080
It contains poisonous tree sap that could literally kill you.

21
0:00:49,080 --> 0:00:50,160
Why are we still standing here?

22
0:00:50,160 --> 0:00:52,800
And meanwhile, Nolan and Mack were making a fire pit.

23
0:00:54,800 --> 0:00:56,560
I'd say it's a pretty good fire, would you say?

24
0:00:56,560 --> 0:00:57,640
Well, it's not a fire yet.

25
0:00:57,640 --> 0:00:59,120
I'd say it's a pretty good fireplace.

26
0:00:59,120 --> 0:01:01,680
And Sean started constructing the frame for our shelter.

27
0:01:01,680 --> 0:01:03,720
Are you sure that's not gonna fall on us?

28
0:01:03,720 --> 0:01:04,200
Yep.

29
0:01:04,200 --> 0:01:06,120
I feel like Sean's like our survival dad.

30
0:01:06,120 --> 0:01:06,800
I've been called worse.

31
0:01:06,800 --> 0:01:10,800
And while gathering some more materials, we came across some wildlife on the island.

32
0:01:10,800 --> 0:01:12,000
Oh, look at these chickens over here.

33
0:01:12,520 --> 0:01:13,880
Hey, wait, stop running away.

34
0:01:13,880 --> 0:01:17,120
And it wasn't long until I found out why the chickens were afraid of us.

35
0:01:17,720 --> 0:01:18,800
Hey, what are we doing over here?

36
0:01:18,800 --> 0:01:19,480
Ah!

37
0:01:19,480 --> 0:01:20,240
Wait, what is that?

38
0:01:20,240 --> 0:01:21,080
Ah, it's a knife.

39
0:01:21,080 --> 0:01:22,760
Were you gonna try to kill one of those chickens?

40
0:01:22,760 --> 0:01:23,760
Please let me eat a chicken.

41
0:01:23,760 --> 0:01:24,640
We don't kill chickens.

42
0:01:24,640 --> 0:01:26,440
Jimmy, what did you eat for dinner before you got here?

43
0:01:26,440 --> 0:01:26,920
Don't ask.

44
0:01:27,640 --> 0:01:31,240
We spent the rest of day one preparing our camp, which was pretty simple.

45
0:01:31,240 --> 0:01:32,600
I'm gonna show you guys around the camp.

46
0:01:32,600 --> 0:01:35,360
This is the fire, and when we're gonna make food, come over here.

47
0:01:36,760 --> 0:01:38,400
And this is where we sleep.

48
0:01:38,400 --> 0:01:39,360
That concludes the tour.

49
0:01:39,360 --> 0:01:42,280
We pulled over our survival crate, which contains food, water,

50
0:01:42,280 --> 0:01:45,160
and most importantly, a flare in case someone gets hurt.

51
0:01:45,160 --> 0:01:49,720
And by the time the sun went down, we had everything figured out, except one thing.

52
0:01:52,440 --> 0:01:53,160
Wait, hold up.

53
0:01:53,160 --> 0:01:54,520
Isn't sunscreen flammable?

54
0:01:55,520 --> 0:01:56,720
Oh!

55
0:01:56,720 --> 0:01:59,640
It's the end of day one, and I'm already starting to get a little sunburn.

56
0:01:59,640 --> 0:02:01,400
I'm hoping to get some good sleep tonight.

57
0:02:01,400 --> 0:02:02,520
And I hope it doesn't rain.

58
0:02:02,520 --> 0:02:04,280
Tomorrow we need to build a bigger shelter.

59
0:02:04,280 --> 0:02:06,880
And by we, I mean dad over there is gonna build a bigger shelter.

60
0:02:06,880 --> 0:02:07,880
I got you.

61
0:02:07,880 --> 0:02:08,800
Oh.

62
0:02:08,800 --> 0:02:09,400
Oh!

63
0:02:09,400 --> 0:02:11,960
Jimmy, you're like mom, Sean's dad.

64
0:02:11,960 --> 0:02:13,080
I'm just gonna go to bed.

65
0:02:13,080 --> 0:02:14,800
I'll see you on day two.

66
0:02:14,800 --> 0:02:18,480
During the first night of sleep, we tossed and turned a lot.

67
0:02:18,480 --> 0:02:20,960
And by we, I mean me.

68
0:02:20,960 --> 0:02:23,920
So it was a good thing we were fixing this the next day.

69
0:02:23,920 --> 0:02:25,960
The objective for day two is simple.

70
0:02:25,960 --> 0:02:28,520
We need to build a bigger and rain-proof shelter.

71
0:02:28,520 --> 0:02:31,200
We need more comfortable seats because my butt hurts,

72
0:02:31,200 --> 0:02:32,640
and we need a better fire pit.

73
0:02:32,640 --> 0:02:35,880
My butt also hurts.

74
0:02:35,880 --> 0:02:38,320
We're looking for very long, sturdy sticks

75
0:02:38,320 --> 0:02:40,000
we can put across the top of our shelter.

76
0:02:40,000 --> 0:02:42,880
That way when it rains, instead of it drooping in the leaves

77
0:02:42,880 --> 0:02:44,680
and tarp, it flows off the back.

78
0:02:44,680 --> 0:02:46,720
And while we were busy gathering resources

79
0:02:46,720 --> 0:02:50,040
for our new shelter, Mack and Nolan were busy looking for new seats.

80
0:02:50,040 --> 0:02:50,880
Do you see that?

81
0:02:50,880 --> 0:02:51,280
Yeah.

82
0:02:51,280 --> 0:02:52,240
What's that orange thing?

83
0:02:52,240 --> 0:02:54,000
You can use it as like a bouncy seat.

84
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Dude, it's a buoy.

85
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:56,160
Oh, dude, there's a net.

86
0:02:56,160 --> 0:02:57,760
We can use the net to catch chickens.

87
0:02:57,760 --> 0:02:58,360
No!

88
0:02:58,360 --> 0:02:59,600
Oh, a lot of bugs!

89
0:02:59,600 --> 0:03:00,440
A lot of bugs!

90
0:03:00,440 --> 0:03:01,520
A lot of bugs!

91
0:03:01,520 --> 0:03:03,320
Jimmy, we found an ocean buoy.

92
0:03:03,320 --> 0:03:04,400
It's like a bouncy seat.

93
0:03:04,400 --> 0:03:05,400
Did you steal this?

94
0:03:05,400 --> 0:03:06,760
No.

95
0:03:06,760 --> 0:03:07,640
Did he steal it?

96
0:03:07,640 --> 0:03:09,760
It washed up on a beach.

97
0:03:09,760 --> 0:03:10,800
I guess that's not stealing.

98
0:03:10,800 --> 0:03:13,200
Oh, that is nice.

99
0:03:13,200 --> 0:03:14,280
OK, I'll take it.

100
0:03:14,280 --> 0:03:15,880
For the rest of the day, Chandler, Sean,

101
0:03:15,880 --> 0:03:17,600
and I finished upgrading the shelter.

102
0:03:17,600 --> 0:03:18,680
Keep going, keep going.

103
0:03:18,680 --> 0:03:20,120
There's still sun in here, but it's

104
0:03:20,120 --> 0:03:21,520
because the sun's super low.

105
0:03:21,560 --> 0:03:23,600
90% of the time, this will be shade now.

106
0:03:23,600 --> 0:03:25,720
While Mack and Nolan got coconuts.

107
0:03:25,720 --> 0:03:26,400
All right.

108
0:03:26,400 --> 0:03:26,960
Be careful.

109
0:03:26,960 --> 0:03:27,640
What's a big knife?

110
0:03:30,640 --> 0:03:31,640
Coconuts!

111
0:03:31,640 --> 0:03:33,720
Oh, that's good.

112
0:03:33,720 --> 0:03:36,200
And of course, tried to catch chickens.

113
0:03:36,200 --> 0:03:37,320
Hey, chickens!

114
0:03:37,320 --> 0:03:38,160
Run!

115
0:03:38,160 --> 0:03:39,000
Run!

116
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:40,560
What are you doing?

117
0:03:40,560 --> 0:03:42,920
All right, I saved them.

118
0:03:42,920 --> 0:03:44,560
Day two is coming to an end.

119
0:03:44,560 --> 0:03:45,680
How would you say it was?

120
0:03:45,680 --> 0:03:47,400
I'm tired, but I'm doing good.

121
0:03:47,400 --> 0:03:48,040
Nolan?

122
0:03:48,040 --> 0:03:49,160
Fantastic.

123
0:03:49,160 --> 0:03:50,400
I think we're going to all agree

124
0:03:50,400 --> 0:03:52,240
we are doing way better than we thought we would.

125
0:03:52,240 --> 0:03:54,560
But little did I know, later that night,

126
0:03:54,560 --> 0:03:56,760
things were about to get a whole lot worse.

127
0:03:56,760 --> 0:03:59,840
But for now, if you're wondering why we're in the ocean,

128
0:03:59,840 --> 0:04:03,400
look at Chandler, because it's the only way for us to shower.

129
0:04:03,400 --> 0:04:06,800
We did our other water for cooking and, you know,

130
0:04:06,800 --> 0:04:07,880
not dying of dehydration.

131
0:04:10,720 --> 0:04:12,400
You want to know what I noticed, boys?

132
0:04:12,400 --> 0:04:13,440
What's that?

133
0:04:13,440 --> 0:04:17,560
We had 10 cartons of water, and now we're down to six.

134
0:04:17,560 --> 0:04:18,600
It's day two.

135
0:04:18,600 --> 0:04:19,320
I know.

136
0:04:19,320 --> 0:04:21,840
I'm going to be the adult here and just say,

137
0:04:21,840 --> 0:04:23,960
everyone needs to be more responsible

138
0:04:23,960 --> 0:04:25,360
with their water consumption.

139
0:04:25,360 --> 0:04:26,120
I agree.

140
0:04:26,120 --> 0:04:27,560
Wait, what are we agreeing to?

141
0:04:27,560 --> 0:04:28,920
Sean, I agreed for you.

142
0:04:28,920 --> 0:04:29,560
OK, perfect.

143
0:04:29,560 --> 0:04:30,160
It's also dark.

144
0:04:30,160 --> 0:04:30,880
We need to go to bed.

145
0:04:30,880 --> 0:04:32,400
In case you didn't piece it together,

146
0:04:32,400 --> 0:04:34,480
that guy, Mac, is the guy that lost money

147
0:04:34,480 --> 0:04:35,720
in this video and this video.

148
0:04:35,720 --> 0:04:38,520
He's basically lost $1.5 million on the channel

149
0:04:38,520 --> 0:04:39,680
in the last two months.

150
0:04:39,680 --> 0:04:41,320
It's a harsh way to introduce somebody.

151
0:04:41,320 --> 0:04:43,000
Even though we upgraded our shelter,

152
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,880
the second night of sleep was worse than the first.

153
0:04:45,880 --> 0:04:47,400
We didn't know it, but this island

154
0:04:47,400 --> 0:04:49,240
was infested with bugs.

155
0:04:49,280 --> 0:04:51,920
That ended up biting us all throughout the night.

156
0:04:51,920 --> 0:04:55,960
And for whatever reason, Jalen and I got the worst of it.

157
0:04:55,960 --> 0:04:58,320
I got no sleep last night.

158
0:04:58,320 --> 0:05:00,200
Probably the most miserable thing I've ever done.

159
0:05:00,200 --> 0:05:03,280
Look how many bug bites I have on just my hand alone.

160
0:05:03,280 --> 0:05:04,480
Do you see that?

161
0:05:04,480 --> 0:05:08,200
And while we caught up on some much needed sleep,

162
0:05:08,200 --> 0:05:09,640
you can probably guess what the boys were

163
0:05:09,640 --> 0:05:11,280
going to do without supervision.

164
0:05:11,280 --> 0:05:12,920
Catch chickens.

165
0:05:12,920 --> 0:05:14,560
No, let's catch fish.

166
0:05:14,560 --> 0:05:17,160
So yesterday, over by that debris on the beach,

167
0:05:17,160 --> 0:05:18,840
me and Nolan found a bunch of net.

168
0:05:18,840 --> 0:05:22,520
And today, the boys are going to help me make a chicken trap.

169
0:05:22,520 --> 0:05:25,080
The plan is basically to put a giant net right here,

170
0:05:25,080 --> 0:05:28,920
tie to a string up there, and then catch a chicken.

171
0:05:28,920 --> 0:05:29,400
Let's go.

172
0:05:29,400 --> 0:05:31,040
Now, if I was awake to stop them,

173
0:05:31,040 --> 0:05:32,120
this never would have happened.

174
0:05:32,120 --> 0:05:34,320
But given the fact that I felt like I was literally

175
0:05:34,320 --> 0:05:37,960
dying in this moment, the boys were officially going rogue.

176
0:05:37,960 --> 0:05:40,360
Hey, strong net.

177
0:05:40,360 --> 0:05:41,280
There we go.

178
0:05:41,280 --> 0:05:42,880
Over the next 30 minutes or so,

179
0:05:42,880 --> 0:05:45,240
the boys cut the net into a perfect square.

180
0:05:45,240 --> 0:05:47,400
They then hoisted the rope up over the tree,

181
0:05:47,400 --> 0:05:51,680
tied the rope to all four corners, and it was ready.

182
0:05:51,680 --> 0:05:52,280
That works?

183
0:05:52,280 --> 0:05:53,040
That's pretty nice.

184
0:05:53,040 --> 0:05:55,280
So after a quick reset in placing some bait,

185
0:05:55,280 --> 0:05:56,920
it was time to catch a chicken.

186
0:05:56,920 --> 0:05:57,760
What is this?

187
0:05:57,760 --> 0:05:59,320
Trap to catch chickens with.

188
0:05:59,320 --> 0:06:00,160
Can I see the rope?

189
0:06:00,160 --> 0:06:00,960
No, you cannot.

190
0:06:00,960 --> 0:06:03,000
Is that what you guys were doing this whole time?

191
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:03,560
Yeah.

192
0:06:03,560 --> 0:06:05,280
I thought you were doing something actually productive.

193
0:06:05,280 --> 0:06:05,920
I'll be honest.

194
0:06:05,920 --> 0:06:08,480
At first, this seemed like a complete waste of time.

195
0:06:08,480 --> 0:06:12,200
Because for the next three hours, they waited and waited.

196
0:06:12,200 --> 0:06:14,200
But for some reason, Mack in particular

197
0:06:14,200 --> 0:06:15,880
was not ready to give up.

198
0:06:15,920 --> 0:06:18,440
And finally, after even more waiting.

199
0:06:28,440 --> 0:06:30,560
Keep it tight, keep it tight, keep it tight.

200
0:06:30,560 --> 0:06:31,800
Mack, what is that?

201
0:06:31,800 --> 0:06:33,760
Hey, I caught it.

202
0:06:33,760 --> 0:06:35,560
Oh, this chicken's actually pretty chill.

203
0:06:35,560 --> 0:06:36,080
Yeah.

204
0:06:36,080 --> 0:06:39,080
This is the new Brian in honor of the bird from raft.

205
0:06:39,080 --> 0:06:39,640
You know what?

206
0:06:39,640 --> 0:06:41,880
With how nice you've been, I'm sure once you put Brian

207
0:06:41,880 --> 0:06:45,320
down, it will continue to hang out with us.

208
0:06:45,320 --> 0:06:45,760
Put it down.

209
0:06:45,800 --> 0:06:47,640
Time to put Brian down.

210
0:06:47,640 --> 0:06:50,360
Brian, no, Brian!

211
0:06:50,360 --> 0:06:51,240
What'd you do to Brian?

212
0:06:51,240 --> 0:06:52,200
I thought he was our friend.

213
0:06:52,200 --> 0:06:54,560
Well, I did catch him with a trap, so.

214
0:06:54,560 --> 0:06:56,960
And by the time Brian had been caught and freed,

215
0:06:56,960 --> 0:06:59,680
it had gotten significantly less hot outside,

216
0:06:59,680 --> 0:07:01,560
which honestly gave all of us enough energy

217
0:07:01,560 --> 0:07:03,160
for a spontaneous adventure.

218
0:07:03,160 --> 0:07:05,400
See that island behind me?

219
0:07:05,400 --> 0:07:07,000
We're about to go do it, Mack.

220
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:07,600
Let's do it.

221
0:07:07,600 --> 0:07:08,760
Now I know what you're thinking.

222
0:07:08,760 --> 0:07:11,320
Why swim away from a perfectly good island

223
0:07:11,320 --> 0:07:13,280
to a rock in the middle of the ocean?

224
0:07:13,280 --> 0:07:15,120
And honestly, I don't have a good answer for you.

225
0:07:15,120 --> 0:07:17,160
This feels really counterintuitive.

226
0:07:17,160 --> 0:07:19,920
I think this is a testament to just how bored we are.

227
0:07:19,920 --> 0:07:22,480
It feels like we're wasting a lot of water and energy.

228
0:07:22,480 --> 0:07:23,720
Mack, what are you doing?

229
0:07:23,720 --> 0:07:25,480
There are so many fish down there.

230
0:07:25,480 --> 0:07:25,960
Really?

231
0:07:25,960 --> 0:07:26,960
Yeah.

232
0:07:26,960 --> 0:07:28,160
There's a stingray.

233
0:07:28,160 --> 0:07:30,240
Look at all those fish.

234
0:07:30,240 --> 0:07:32,560
Those waves look really big over there.

235
0:07:32,560 --> 0:07:33,760
And they're coming right at us.

236
0:07:33,760 --> 0:07:34,560
Oh, no!

237
0:07:34,560 --> 0:07:35,840
Oh, hey, that was a big one.

238
0:07:35,840 --> 0:07:38,320
We're almost there!

239
0:07:38,320 --> 0:07:41,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

240
0:07:41,040 --> 0:07:44,160
Look at the island over there in the background.

241
0:07:44,200 --> 0:07:46,040
And here we are.

242
0:07:46,040 --> 0:07:46,680
Look at this.

243
0:07:46,680 --> 0:07:48,760
We've got water splashing on both sides.

244
0:07:48,760 --> 0:07:50,440
These are an extra slippery rocks.

245
0:07:50,440 --> 0:07:51,520
Going up now?

246
0:07:51,520 --> 0:07:53,520
Oh, gosh.

247
0:07:53,520 --> 0:07:54,840
This looks so cool.

248
0:07:54,840 --> 0:07:56,320
We did it!

249
0:07:56,320 --> 0:08:00,040
I don't know why we did it, but we did!

250
0:08:00,040 --> 0:08:01,480
How do we get off this?

251
0:08:01,480 --> 0:08:03,160
And then how do we get back to our island?

252
0:08:03,160 --> 0:08:04,800
Well, the fastest way off is jumping.

253
0:08:04,800 --> 0:08:05,960
I'm not jumping.

254
0:08:05,960 --> 0:08:07,840
During our last few hours of sunlight,

255
0:08:07,840 --> 0:08:09,000
I felt a couple raindrops.

256
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,360
We noticed a storm approaching us on the horizon.

257
0:08:11,360 --> 0:08:13,040
When we got on the island, the forecast said

258
0:08:13,040 --> 0:08:14,240
it wasn't supposed to rain.

259
0:08:14,240 --> 0:08:15,800
There's monster clouds over there.

260
0:08:15,800 --> 0:08:16,400
We'd be depressed.

261
0:08:16,400 --> 0:08:17,120
Let's go, boys.

262
0:08:17,120 --> 0:08:18,800
Come on, guys.

263
0:08:18,800 --> 0:08:19,640
Fix the hut.

264
0:08:19,640 --> 0:08:20,360
Oh, no.

265
0:08:20,360 --> 0:08:21,280
There's rain coming!

266
0:08:21,280 --> 0:08:22,120
Protect our stuff.

267
0:08:22,120 --> 0:08:23,920
Get as many palm leaves as you can right now.

268
0:08:23,920 --> 0:08:24,480
Let's tell it.

269
0:08:24,480 --> 0:08:25,280
More leaves.

270
0:08:25,280 --> 0:08:26,840
And once we ran out of daylight,

271
0:08:26,840 --> 0:08:29,320
we huddled up under our new and improved shelter

272
0:08:29,320 --> 0:08:30,880
and awaited a night of rain.

273
0:08:30,880 --> 0:08:33,720
The worst part about this is the unknown.

274
0:08:33,720 --> 0:08:34,960
It's so dark, you can't even

275
0:08:34,960 --> 0:08:36,640
see how close the rain is anymore.

276
0:08:36,640 --> 0:08:38,480
Turns out we got extremely lucky.

277
0:08:38,480 --> 0:08:41,080
The storm ended up just missing us by a hair.

278
0:08:41,080 --> 0:08:43,480
But what I can say is, later in this video,

279
0:08:43,480 --> 0:08:44,960
we won't be so lucky.

280
0:08:44,960 --> 0:08:46,000
Wait for me here!

281
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:47,440
It's literally pouring!

282
0:08:47,440 --> 0:08:48,680
Honey, hold this up!

283
0:08:48,680 --> 0:08:50,360
I just want to go home.

284
0:08:50,360 --> 0:08:53,160
Good morning, everybody.

285
0:08:53,160 --> 0:08:54,160
Let me try that again.

286
0:08:54,160 --> 0:08:55,880
Good morning, everybody.

287
0:08:55,880 --> 0:08:56,760
Good morning.

288
0:08:56,760 --> 0:08:58,400
You guys got a case of the Mondays?

289
0:08:58,400 --> 0:08:59,880
After four days on the island,

290
0:08:59,880 --> 0:09:02,280
our morning routine consisted of the following.

291
0:09:02,280 --> 0:09:04,800
First, we'd wake up and complain about how bad we slept.

292
0:09:04,800 --> 0:09:06,880
Just leave them last night with it rough.

293
0:09:06,880 --> 0:09:10,120
And then we'd use the bathroom, sometimes together.

294
0:09:10,160 --> 0:09:12,000
I'm nervous, painless, at the same time as you guys.

295
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:14,320
And then eat, yet again, a bag meal.

296
0:09:14,320 --> 0:09:16,720
We're a little tired of our bag meals.

297
0:09:16,720 --> 0:09:19,320
So let's just say we've got a solution.

298
0:09:21,600 --> 0:09:23,280
All right, this is as far as I go.

299
0:09:23,280 --> 0:09:24,120
Have fun.

300
0:09:24,120 --> 0:09:24,960
Oh my God.

301
0:09:24,960 --> 0:09:26,000
All this for some fish?

302
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
You have to go very, very far out to actually find fish.

303
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,080
The fish aren't going to be in this light blue water.

304
0:09:31,080 --> 0:09:33,200
They're going to be in the dark blue water out there.

305
0:09:33,200 --> 0:09:35,280
So this is going to be a really good idea,

306
0:09:35,280 --> 0:09:36,400
a really bad one.

307
0:09:36,400 --> 0:09:37,360
Probably a bad one.

308
0:09:37,360 --> 0:09:39,960
The plan was a little dangerous, but simple.

309
0:09:40,000 --> 0:09:42,280
Mack is going to act as a human motorboat

310
0:09:42,280 --> 0:09:45,600
and drag Sean and Nolan out into the depths of the ocean.

311
0:09:45,600 --> 0:09:48,440
And Sean, being the expert survival dad that he is,

312
0:09:48,440 --> 0:09:49,920
is going to catch those fish

313
0:09:49,920 --> 0:09:52,680
and bring them back to shore for us to eat.

314
0:09:52,680 --> 0:09:53,640
You guys got the rope?

315
0:09:53,640 --> 0:09:55,520
I also brought around 500 feet of rope

316
0:09:55,520 --> 0:09:56,360
that they're tied to.

317
0:09:56,360 --> 0:09:57,880
So if at any point they need help,

318
0:09:57,880 --> 0:09:59,640
we'll just yank them in, right, Chandler?

319
0:09:59,640 --> 0:10:00,400
Yeah.

320
0:10:00,400 --> 0:10:01,640
Is the rope still good?

321
0:10:01,640 --> 0:10:03,000
Yeah, you have plenty of ropes.

322
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:04,920
Mack, you doing OK?

323
0:10:04,920 --> 0:10:06,520
Is Mack literally just pulling them?

324
0:10:06,520 --> 0:10:08,600
We should just untie the rope, Mack.

325
0:10:08,640 --> 0:10:09,800
That's some dead weight.

326
0:10:09,800 --> 0:10:12,520
We'll be over the ground, Ed.

327
0:10:12,520 --> 0:10:15,520
Now we have no rope, and we're so far away from the beach.

328
0:10:15,520 --> 0:10:17,840
There's no way they're not getting seasick out there.

329
0:10:17,840 --> 0:10:18,720
Oh, look at that storm.

330
0:10:18,720 --> 0:10:19,560
Is that a storm?

331
0:10:19,560 --> 0:10:20,800
Boys, we better hurry.

332
0:10:20,800 --> 0:10:21,360
That's rain?

333
0:10:21,360 --> 0:10:22,000
That's rain.

334
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:24,440
Something tells me this rope snapped somewhere.

335
0:10:24,440 --> 0:10:25,560
Oh, no.

336
0:10:25,560 --> 0:10:26,440
You know what we can do?

337
0:10:26,440 --> 0:10:27,360
We can start fishing.

338
0:10:27,360 --> 0:10:28,320
That wouldn't start forcing me.

339
0:10:28,320 --> 0:10:29,320
He's in the water.

340
0:10:29,320 --> 0:10:30,000
Guys!

341
0:10:30,000 --> 0:10:33,520
Your rope came off!

342
0:10:33,520 --> 0:10:34,920
You see any fish down there?

343
0:10:34,920 --> 0:10:35,960
I don't see anything.

344
0:10:35,960 --> 0:10:36,480
None yet.

345
0:10:36,480 --> 0:10:37,880
We have the rope!

346
0:10:37,880 --> 0:10:39,520
Hey!

347
0:10:39,520 --> 0:10:40,840
Oh, you got something?

348
0:10:40,840 --> 0:10:43,320
Yeah, yeah.

349
0:10:43,320 --> 0:10:44,320
Hey!

350
0:10:44,320 --> 0:10:45,320
We got a fish!

351
0:10:45,320 --> 0:10:46,320
Hold on, hold on.

352
0:10:46,320 --> 0:10:47,320
Yeah!

353
0:10:47,320 --> 0:10:48,320
We got a fish!

354
0:10:48,320 --> 0:10:51,320
Yeah!

355
0:10:51,320 --> 0:10:54,440
And after two hours of fishing and 200 fishes

356
0:10:54,440 --> 0:10:57,000
where the calories burned, all they had to show for it

357
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:57,920
was one fish.

358
0:11:00,480 --> 0:11:01,240
Is this fine to eat?

359
0:11:01,240 --> 0:11:02,960
Yeah, of course.

360
0:11:02,960 --> 0:11:05,040
It literally tastes like fish from a supermarket.

361
0:11:05,040 --> 0:11:06,240
I mean, you know where fish from the supermarket

362
0:11:06,240 --> 0:11:06,920
come from, right?

363
0:11:06,920 --> 0:11:07,560
Where?

364
0:11:07,560 --> 0:11:08,160
The ocean.

365
0:11:08,160 --> 0:11:09,880
And even though this fish from the ocean

366
0:11:09,880 --> 0:11:12,320
was surprisingly good, it was time to eat something

367
0:11:12,320 --> 0:11:13,480
a whole lot better.

368
0:11:13,480 --> 0:11:14,080
S'mores!

369
0:11:14,080 --> 0:11:14,720
S'mores!

370
0:11:14,720 --> 0:11:17,320
First off, you need to burn the bacteria off your stick?

371
0:11:17,320 --> 0:11:18,200
Oh, I didn't know that, actually.

372
0:11:18,200 --> 0:11:19,760
You seem like you've done s'mores before, Jim.

373
0:11:19,760 --> 0:11:21,960
Oh, there's a man who owns a chocolate company.

374
0:11:21,960 --> 0:11:23,680
Oh, Mack!

375
0:11:23,680 --> 0:11:24,760
What are you doing?

376
0:11:24,760 --> 0:11:25,760
Oh, oh, God.

377
0:11:25,760 --> 0:11:27,200
You take the feastables chocolate,

378
0:11:27,200 --> 0:11:29,720
scrunch it like that while it's still hot.

379
0:11:29,720 --> 0:11:30,760
Look at that.

380
0:11:30,760 --> 0:11:32,400
Make sure to try out our new feastables bar.

381
0:11:32,400 --> 0:11:34,280
People are actually liking it so much,

382
0:11:34,280 --> 0:11:35,680
it's sold out in most stores.

383
0:11:35,680 --> 0:11:36,720
Don't worry, we're doing our best

384
0:11:36,760 --> 0:11:38,080
to restock it as fast as we can.

385
0:11:38,080 --> 0:11:39,800
You've never had a s'more in your life

386
0:11:39,800 --> 0:11:42,440
until you've had a s'more with feastables on it.

387
0:11:42,440 --> 0:11:44,280
By clockwork, we lay down and go to bed

388
0:11:44,280 --> 0:11:45,640
and it starts raining.

389
0:11:45,640 --> 0:11:48,120
Why is it that whenever we do survival videos,

390
0:11:48,120 --> 0:11:50,360
it literally only rains when we're trying to sleep?

391
0:11:50,360 --> 0:11:52,600
I'd say that was a very successful day for.

392
0:11:52,600 --> 0:11:53,600
Yeah, I agree.

393
0:11:53,600 --> 0:11:54,600
You caught a chicken.

394
0:11:54,600 --> 0:11:55,440
I caught a fish.

395
0:11:55,440 --> 0:11:58,440
Here's the three more days of stupidity.

396
0:11:58,440 --> 0:11:59,440
Yeah!

397
0:12:06,880 --> 0:12:07,720
I just woke up.

398
0:12:07,720 --> 0:12:08,920
I have no idea what day it is.

399
0:12:08,920 --> 0:12:10,040
Stay up.

400
0:12:10,040 --> 0:12:11,440
Five.

401
0:12:11,440 --> 0:12:13,280
I was about to say that.

402
0:12:13,280 --> 0:12:15,240
One of the reasons why we picked this island

403
0:12:15,240 --> 0:12:18,120
is there's very old houses or ruins,

404
0:12:18,120 --> 0:12:19,760
whatever you want to call it, on this island.

405
0:12:19,760 --> 0:12:22,040
And even though they're located on top of the mountain,

406
0:12:22,040 --> 0:12:23,880
I say today's the day we explore them.

407
0:12:23,880 --> 0:12:25,400
I agree, disagree.

408
0:12:25,400 --> 0:12:27,600
Now that we had all agreed to go to the ruins,

409
0:12:27,600 --> 0:12:29,720
we wanted to make sure we didn't start this expedition

410
0:12:29,720 --> 0:12:30,760
on an empty stomach.

411
0:12:30,760 --> 0:12:33,120
And just as we were eating our bagged breakfast,

412
0:12:33,120 --> 0:12:35,960
no one noticed something more appetizing down the beach.

413
0:12:35,960 --> 0:12:37,000
Over there on the shoreline.

414
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:37,600
What is it?

415
0:12:37,600 --> 0:12:38,440
There's a goat.

416
0:12:38,440 --> 0:12:39,200
No way, bro.

417
0:12:39,200 --> 0:12:40,880
There's a goat!

418
0:12:40,880 --> 0:12:42,480
Mack, you cannot eat that.

419
0:12:42,480 --> 0:12:43,400
You can't stop me.

420
0:12:43,400 --> 0:12:44,480
No.

421
0:12:44,480 --> 0:12:45,600
Run away, goat!

422
0:12:45,600 --> 0:12:46,160
Jimmy!

423
0:12:46,160 --> 0:12:47,400
Run away!

424
0:12:47,400 --> 0:12:48,520
Go!

425
0:12:48,520 --> 0:12:50,120
Get out of here!

426
0:12:50,120 --> 0:12:50,880
Yes!

427
0:12:50,880 --> 0:12:51,840
Why did you do that?

428
0:12:51,840 --> 0:12:53,880
He's our friend.

429
0:12:53,880 --> 0:12:54,560
No, he's not.

430
0:12:54,560 --> 0:12:55,280
He's food.

431
0:12:55,280 --> 0:12:56,200
Oh, once again.

432
0:12:56,200 --> 0:12:57,720
Jimmy has scared away my food.

433
0:12:57,720 --> 0:12:59,960
And after sparing another animal from Mack,

434
0:12:59,960 --> 0:13:02,000
it was time to adventure to the ruins.

435
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:03,320
All right, let's do it.

436
0:13:03,320 --> 0:13:04,680
We're almost out of water, guys.

437
0:13:04,680 --> 0:13:06,080
I need some for the adventure.

438
0:13:06,080 --> 0:13:07,560
I'm going to try to fill these up with coconut water

439
0:13:07,560 --> 0:13:08,280
while you're gone.

440
0:13:08,280 --> 0:13:08,600
Let's go.

441
0:13:08,600 --> 0:13:09,440
Let's do it.

442
0:13:09,440 --> 0:13:10,120
Yeah, keep going.

443
0:13:10,120 --> 0:13:11,120
I'll be there in one second.

444
0:13:11,120 --> 0:13:12,680
And what they don't know is I actually

445
0:13:12,680 --> 0:13:15,640
have a surprise waiting for us at the top of the ruins.

446
0:13:15,640 --> 0:13:17,240
It'll make sense in a little bit.

447
0:13:17,240 --> 0:13:17,880
That was kind of weird.

448
0:13:17,880 --> 0:13:19,440
I just stayed back and talked to the camera.

449
0:13:19,440 --> 0:13:22,800
Yeah, kind of like how you lost $1.5 million.

450
0:13:22,800 --> 0:13:23,440
Oh, yeah.

451
0:13:23,440 --> 0:13:24,560
Follow me, gang.

452
0:13:24,560 --> 0:13:25,560
Jimmy, I believe in you.

453
0:13:25,560 --> 0:13:27,360
For a second, I thought this was the mountain.

454
0:13:27,360 --> 0:13:29,680
My God, we haven't even reached the base of the mountain

455
0:13:29,680 --> 0:13:30,000
yet.

456
0:13:30,000 --> 0:13:31,160
And while we climb this mountain,

457
0:13:31,160 --> 0:13:33,000
I'm going to tell the boys about Western Union.

458
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:34,680
Wherever you are, Western Union makes

459
0:13:34,680 --> 0:13:36,480
it easy to send money to friends and family

460
0:13:36,480 --> 0:13:37,560
anywhere in the world.

461
0:13:37,560 --> 0:13:38,320
We'll be up here.

462
0:13:38,320 --> 0:13:39,520
Yeah, you keep talking about that, Jim.

463
0:13:39,520 --> 0:13:40,480
Hey, wait up for me.

464
0:13:40,480 --> 0:13:41,560
We're going all the way up there.

465
0:13:41,560 --> 0:13:44,880
Western Union also has a free website and app

466
0:13:44,880 --> 0:13:46,520
that's simple and secure.

467
0:13:46,520 --> 0:13:47,760
So even my grandma can use it?

468
0:13:47,760 --> 0:13:49,360
Even your grandma, Mac.

469
0:13:49,360 --> 0:13:53,320
And before I got here, I used Western Union to pay the boat.

470
0:13:53,320 --> 0:13:54,560
Dude, you got to be careful.

471
0:13:54,560 --> 0:13:55,720
Here, give me a second Western Union.

472
0:13:55,720 --> 0:13:58,120
I also used Western Union to pay the boat guy that

473
0:13:58,120 --> 0:13:59,400
dropped me off on this island.

474
0:13:59,400 --> 0:14:01,360
Because they had been around for 100 years,

475
0:14:01,360 --> 0:14:04,440
I know my money caught to him even though I was in the US.

476
0:14:04,440 --> 0:14:07,640
Look how far away we've come from our beach.

477
0:14:07,640 --> 0:14:08,760
Is that a rainbow?

478
0:14:08,760 --> 0:14:09,760
Rainbow right there.

479
0:14:09,760 --> 0:14:10,640
Oh, yeah.

480
0:14:10,640 --> 0:14:11,680
That's awesome.

481
0:14:11,680 --> 0:14:13,320
I'm not going to be like a Debbie Downer,

482
0:14:13,320 --> 0:14:14,840
but that's rain right there.

483
0:14:14,840 --> 0:14:15,560
That giant cloud?

484
0:14:15,560 --> 0:14:16,440
That giant cloud with rain coming out.

485
0:14:16,440 --> 0:14:17,560
Yeah, you're being a Debbie Downer.

486
0:14:17,560 --> 0:14:19,560
Hey, you can see Sean from here.

487
0:14:19,560 --> 0:14:20,800
Dude, he's building the shelter.

488
0:14:20,800 --> 0:14:21,920
Sean's making us dinner.

489
0:14:21,920 --> 0:14:22,920
Sean!

490
0:14:25,440 --> 0:14:26,920
I can see him!

491
0:14:26,920 --> 0:14:28,720
Sean!

492
0:14:28,720 --> 0:14:29,480
You heard him?

493
0:14:29,480 --> 0:14:30,680
Keep going!

494
0:14:30,720 --> 0:14:33,120
Wave if you're a nerd!

495
0:14:33,120 --> 0:14:33,960
Oh, he's waving.

496
0:14:33,960 --> 0:14:35,880
Is it going to be dark when we go back on this path?

497
0:14:35,880 --> 0:14:36,360
Yeah.

498
0:14:36,360 --> 0:14:37,160
How are we going to see?

499
0:14:37,160 --> 0:14:38,320
Oh, we'll figure that out later.

500
0:14:38,320 --> 0:14:40,280
That's going to be unfortunate if somebody falls.

501
0:14:40,280 --> 0:14:41,280
Oh!

502
0:14:41,280 --> 0:14:41,760
Are you good?

503
0:14:41,760 --> 0:14:42,560
You good?

504
0:14:42,560 --> 0:14:43,600
I'm alive.

505
0:14:43,600 --> 0:14:44,480
See that right over there?

506
0:14:44,480 --> 0:14:46,080
Boys, come on.

507
0:14:46,080 --> 0:14:46,880
Come over here.

508
0:14:46,880 --> 0:14:48,600
Welcome to the Ruins.

509
0:14:48,600 --> 0:14:50,160
This is actually sick, dude.

510
0:14:50,160 --> 0:14:51,440
Why is there just a yellow box?

511
0:14:51,440 --> 0:14:52,240
Yeah, what is this thing?

512
0:14:52,240 --> 0:14:53,200
I'm glad you asked.

513
0:14:53,200 --> 0:14:56,040
I paid some guys with Western Union $10,000

514
0:14:56,040 --> 0:14:58,120
to move this box up here.

515
0:14:58,120 --> 0:14:58,560
Really?

516
0:14:58,560 --> 0:15:00,600
Nolan, there's a crowbar in your backpack.

517
0:15:01,240 --> 0:15:02,120
What do you think's in here?

518
0:15:02,120 --> 0:15:02,640
Pizza?

519
0:15:02,640 --> 0:15:03,920
You knew that we were going to run out of water,

520
0:15:03,920 --> 0:15:05,600
so you put extra water in this box.

521
0:15:05,600 --> 0:15:06,600
And while we're opening this,

522
0:15:06,600 --> 0:15:08,560
there's never been a better time to download or sign up

523
0:15:08,560 --> 0:15:09,400
for Western Union.

524
0:15:09,400 --> 0:15:11,320
Your first transaction is free.

525
0:15:11,320 --> 0:15:13,320
Just go to WesternUnion.com slash Mr. B's.

526
0:15:13,320 --> 0:15:14,720
Now, I know I could have filled this crate

527
0:15:14,720 --> 0:15:16,120
with extra water and food,

528
0:15:16,120 --> 0:15:18,120
but instead I brought something even better.

529
0:15:18,120 --> 0:15:19,920
Matt, does this moment remind you of something?

530
0:15:21,120 --> 0:15:22,800
Well, this picture of you losing 800 grand.

531
0:15:22,800 --> 0:15:24,760
Now, here's a picture of you losing 700 grand.

532
0:15:24,760 --> 0:15:26,600
Bro, why?

533
0:15:26,600 --> 0:15:27,040
Why go a little further?

534
0:15:27,040 --> 0:15:28,040
You'll see it one second.

535
0:15:28,040 --> 0:15:28,440
Don't worry.

536
0:15:28,440 --> 0:15:30,400
Now, I didn't do this to make fun of Matt

537
0:15:30,400 --> 0:15:32,040
for losing $1.5 million.

538
0:15:32,040 --> 0:15:32,400
Really?

539
0:15:32,400 --> 0:15:34,360
Because that's exactly what it feels like you're doing.

540
0:15:34,360 --> 0:15:36,440
I did this to say we're going to give you

541
0:15:36,440 --> 0:15:38,040
another chance at one final video.

542
0:15:38,040 --> 0:15:38,720
No shot.

543
0:15:38,720 --> 0:15:39,920
But this is your final shot.

544
0:15:39,920 --> 0:15:40,880
You're going to give me a third shot?

545
0:15:40,880 --> 0:15:41,600
Your final shot.

546
0:15:41,600 --> 0:15:42,400
I got another shot!

547
0:15:42,400 --> 0:15:43,840
If you look at the last video we did,

548
0:15:43,840 --> 0:15:46,200
every single comment was bring back Mac, bring back Mac.

549
0:15:46,200 --> 0:15:46,960
I hope you win.

550
0:15:46,960 --> 0:15:47,720
That's another shot.

551
0:15:47,720 --> 0:15:49,200
More important than your shot.

552
0:15:49,200 --> 0:15:50,080
There's some ruins over here.

553
0:15:50,080 --> 0:15:50,680
Let's go look at them.

554
0:15:50,680 --> 0:15:51,640
Third shot, baby.

555
0:15:51,640 --> 0:15:52,720
I'm not going to let you guys down again.

556
0:15:52,720 --> 0:15:55,040
This building is almost a century old.

557
0:15:55,040 --> 0:15:56,960
Imagine building this 100 years ago

558
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:59,640
just for a bunch of YouTubers to explore it.

559
0:15:59,640 --> 0:16:00,640
Whoa!

560
0:16:00,640 --> 0:16:02,400
This is wicked.

561
0:16:02,400 --> 0:16:03,560
Why is there a cactus up there?

562
0:16:03,560 --> 0:16:05,080
Does the cactus just crawl up there

563
0:16:05,080 --> 0:16:06,440
or does someone put the cactus up there?

564
0:16:06,440 --> 0:16:08,160
The cactus does not crawl up there, Jimmy.

565
0:16:08,160 --> 0:16:08,960
It doesn't have legs.

566
0:16:08,960 --> 0:16:09,800
Oh my god.

567
0:16:09,800 --> 0:16:11,640
Let's check out on the other side of the crate.

568
0:16:11,640 --> 0:16:13,080
There's some more ruins over there.

569
0:16:13,080 --> 0:16:14,360
This is crazy, dude.

570
0:16:14,360 --> 0:16:17,680
Look how the trees wrap around the rocks.

571
0:16:17,680 --> 0:16:19,560
Would the gangs say this was worth the effort?

572
0:16:19,560 --> 0:16:21,320
Because I got a third chance, yes I would.

573
0:16:21,320 --> 0:16:21,640
All right.

574
0:16:21,640 --> 0:16:22,600
Well, he's biased.

575
0:16:22,600 --> 0:16:23,680
Would you two say it was worth it?

576
0:16:23,680 --> 0:16:24,120
No.

577
0:16:24,120 --> 0:16:26,120
There was no pizza in the box, so no.

578
0:16:26,120 --> 0:16:29,120
By this time, Day 5 Sun was setting on the island.

579
0:16:29,120 --> 0:16:32,120
And on our way back to camp, we stopped at the peak of the mountain

580
0:16:32,120 --> 0:16:33,400
to take it all in.

581
0:16:33,400 --> 0:16:36,240
There's no one I'd rather scale the side of a random mountain

582
0:16:36,240 --> 0:16:37,200
with than you guys.

583
0:16:37,200 --> 0:16:37,960
Thank you.

584
0:16:37,960 --> 0:16:39,320
Maybe Dwayne The Rock Johnson.

585
0:16:39,320 --> 0:16:39,840
That's fair.

586
0:16:39,840 --> 0:16:41,280
But outside of that, nobody.

587
0:16:41,280 --> 0:16:42,360
Well, as I'm going to be honest,

588
0:16:42,360 --> 0:16:43,760
probably going to remember this forever.

589
0:16:43,760 --> 0:16:44,600
Me too.

590
0:16:44,600 --> 0:16:46,840
I think this view made the journey worth it.

591
0:16:46,840 --> 0:16:47,800
Camp's cleaned up.

592
0:16:47,800 --> 0:16:50,240
It's been reinforced from the rain, coconut water.

593
0:16:50,240 --> 0:16:51,520
Meals ready to go.

594
0:16:51,520 --> 0:16:52,520
Got a lot more water.

595
0:16:52,520 --> 0:16:53,520
It's getting really dark.

596
0:16:53,520 --> 0:16:55,640
I mean, you can't even see into the woods right now.

597
0:16:55,640 --> 0:16:55,920
I don't know.

598
0:16:55,920 --> 0:16:58,080
They're going to make it back from the top of that mountain

599
0:16:58,080 --> 0:16:59,760
through all these woods in the dark.

600
0:16:59,760 --> 0:17:03,400
This is way sketchier at night.

601
0:17:03,400 --> 0:17:03,960
Ow.

602
0:17:03,960 --> 0:17:04,520
Cactus.

603
0:17:04,520 --> 0:17:05,320
Ow.

604
0:17:05,320 --> 0:17:05,800
You good?

605
0:17:05,800 --> 0:17:06,960
Just a thorn on my side.

606
0:17:06,960 --> 0:17:09,080
But little did we know running into a cactus

607
0:17:09,080 --> 0:17:10,680
in the middle of the night was actually

608
0:17:10,680 --> 0:17:12,080
the least of our worries.

609
0:17:12,080 --> 0:17:14,040
We ended up hitting a dead end,

610
0:17:14,040 --> 0:17:17,280
which is a little intimidating in the middle of a forest.

611
0:17:17,280 --> 0:17:18,080
What direction is it?

612
0:17:18,080 --> 0:17:19,280
Is it this way or that way?

613
0:17:19,280 --> 0:17:20,720
Wait, I can see three different things.

614
0:17:20,720 --> 0:17:21,760
Dude, there's this right here.

615
0:17:21,760 --> 0:17:22,960
And then there's this one right here.

616
0:17:22,960 --> 0:17:23,880
This is a path, too.

617
0:17:23,880 --> 0:17:24,880
Like, are you sure?

618
0:17:25,840 --> 0:17:26,600
Or is that it?

619
0:17:26,600 --> 0:17:27,880
It's definitely not to.

620
0:17:27,880 --> 0:17:28,520
Follow me.

621
0:17:28,520 --> 0:17:30,280
Guys, I will pick a random direction.

622
0:17:30,280 --> 0:17:30,880
Wait, I know.

623
0:17:30,880 --> 0:17:31,800
I think it is to the left.

624
0:17:31,800 --> 0:17:32,240
Oh, it is to the right.

625
0:17:32,240 --> 0:17:33,320
No, it's right over here.

626
0:17:33,320 --> 0:17:34,240
Ah, it's raining.

627
0:17:34,240 --> 0:17:36,200
And we must have been extra lucky that night,

628
0:17:36,200 --> 0:17:39,040
because on top of being lost, it started raining.

629
0:17:39,040 --> 0:17:40,280
Are you sure this is the right one?

630
0:17:40,280 --> 0:17:41,160
I mean, it's this way.

631
0:17:41,160 --> 0:17:41,960
Which way are we going?

632
0:17:41,960 --> 0:17:43,000
I told you we should fly out.

633
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:43,480
Wait, Taylor.

634
0:17:43,480 --> 0:17:44,000
Follow me.

635
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:45,280
Taylor, how sure are you?

636
0:17:45,280 --> 0:17:46,360
I'm 10% sure it's this way.

637
0:17:46,360 --> 0:17:48,760
So wouldn't 90% be better?

638
0:17:48,760 --> 0:17:49,600
Are you 90%?

639
0:17:49,600 --> 0:17:50,440
Can we choose?

640
0:17:50,440 --> 0:17:52,160
It's pouring on the side of a mountain.

641
0:17:52,160 --> 0:17:52,760
Go!

642
0:17:52,760 --> 0:17:53,520
It's raining.

643
0:17:53,520 --> 0:17:55,680
Wait, why don't we choose and then un-choose?

644
0:17:55,680 --> 0:17:56,520
I don't care.

645
0:17:56,520 --> 0:17:58,080
Oh, boy, this is bad.

646
0:17:58,080 --> 0:17:59,480
It is getting slick.

647
0:17:59,480 --> 0:18:01,920
I really don't think we came up with something to see.

648
0:18:01,920 --> 0:18:03,440
Oh, I almost face planted.

649
0:18:03,440 --> 0:18:05,680
And if we couldn't be any more unlucky,

650
0:18:05,680 --> 0:18:07,680
on top of it raining while we're lost,

651
0:18:07,680 --> 0:18:09,680
we've even got a third thing to worry about.

652
0:18:09,680 --> 0:18:12,280
Above you is the most dangerous tree on Earth.

653
0:18:12,280 --> 0:18:15,440
If it rains, it will seep poison that will burn your skin.

654
0:18:15,440 --> 0:18:18,320
Watch out for the death apple sap, because it just rained.

655
0:18:18,320 --> 0:18:19,160
What are we supposed to do?

656
0:18:19,160 --> 0:18:21,080
Not let the poison drip on you.

657
0:18:21,120 --> 0:18:23,760
Oh, that is 10,000% of death apple tree, boys.

658
0:18:23,760 --> 0:18:24,600
That means we're close.

659
0:18:24,600 --> 0:18:27,040
And regardless of if we took the right path or not,

660
0:18:27,040 --> 0:18:28,920
we could tell we were getting close to camp.

661
0:18:28,920 --> 0:18:29,480
That's sad.

662
0:18:29,480 --> 0:18:30,760
That's sad.

663
0:18:30,760 --> 0:18:31,240
Thank God.

664
0:18:31,240 --> 0:18:31,760
We made it.

665
0:18:31,760 --> 0:18:32,720
The camp is right there.

666
0:18:32,720 --> 0:18:34,600
We have a rare opportunity to scare Sean.

667
0:18:34,600 --> 0:18:35,920
Are we going to take advantage of that?

668
0:18:35,920 --> 0:18:36,920
Yes, of course.

669
0:18:36,920 --> 0:18:38,920
OK.

670
0:18:46,360 --> 0:18:47,120
Oh, God.

671
0:18:47,120 --> 0:18:48,560
Oh, my God, you scared me.

672
0:18:48,560 --> 0:18:49,080
We made it.

673
0:18:49,080 --> 0:18:49,760
Yeah, we're back.

674
0:18:49,760 --> 0:18:51,480
I made you guys dinner in coconut water.

675
0:18:51,480 --> 0:18:52,680
Oh, I appreciate it.

676
0:18:52,680 --> 0:18:54,680
Cheers, boys.

677
0:18:54,680 --> 0:18:56,680
Wow, it tastes like a coconut.

678
0:18:56,680 --> 0:18:59,680
After the hike, we ate, we showered.

679
0:18:59,680 --> 0:19:01,960
And when we dried off, we took a second

680
0:19:01,960 --> 0:19:04,080
to look up at the stars.

681
0:19:04,080 --> 0:19:06,160
Because when you're in the middle of the ocean,

682
0:19:06,160 --> 0:19:08,360
it really feels like you're on another planet.

683
0:19:12,360 --> 0:19:15,520
But unexpectedly, around the corner

684
0:19:15,520 --> 0:19:18,160
was something we've been fearing this entire challenge.

685
0:19:19,800 --> 0:19:20,600
You feel that?

686
0:19:20,600 --> 0:19:22,040
Guys, bad news.

687
0:19:22,040 --> 0:19:24,080
There's a ton of water on the top of our shelter.

688
0:19:24,080 --> 0:19:25,360
I just don't know if that's going to be safe for us

689
0:19:25,360 --> 0:19:26,080
to be under it.

690
0:19:26,080 --> 0:19:27,560
Despite our efforts from earlier

691
0:19:27,560 --> 0:19:29,440
to make the shelter better, water

692
0:19:29,440 --> 0:19:32,040
was beginning to pull up on our roof from the storm.

693
0:19:32,040 --> 0:19:35,240
All this water on top of this, is there a world

694
0:19:35,240 --> 0:19:36,760
that could bring our structure down?

695
0:19:36,760 --> 0:19:38,680
And even though all we wanted at this point

696
0:19:38,680 --> 0:19:42,640
was a night of sleep, we had to get up and deal with it.

697
0:19:42,640 --> 0:19:45,560
Oh, my God, we are absolutely screwed.

698
0:19:45,560 --> 0:19:49,200
I'm just getting destoyed and pummeled by rain all night.

699
0:19:49,200 --> 0:19:52,640
And after two hours of rain, a damaged shelter,

700
0:19:52,640 --> 0:19:55,560
and soaking wet beds, there was no chance

701
0:19:55,560 --> 0:19:57,120
any of us were going to sleep that night.

702
0:19:57,120 --> 0:19:58,920
It's raining on you at night.

703
0:19:58,920 --> 0:20:01,640
The worst experience you can have on these shelters.

704
0:20:01,640 --> 0:20:03,040
I'm so tired.

705
0:20:03,040 --> 0:20:04,880
Hopefully it just passes over.

706
0:20:04,880 --> 0:20:07,280
And even though this was an all-time low,

707
0:20:07,280 --> 0:20:09,480
our only option was to wait this thing out.

708
0:20:12,400 --> 0:20:14,280
I'm not going to lie, the rain last night

709
0:20:14,280 --> 0:20:15,480
was pretty brutal.

710
0:20:15,480 --> 0:20:19,200
I don't know if I've ever been that cold, ever.

711
0:20:19,200 --> 0:20:21,000
What do you want to do today, Nolan?

712
0:20:21,000 --> 0:20:21,720
I don't know.

713
0:20:21,720 --> 0:20:23,200
Absolutely nothing.

714
0:20:23,200 --> 0:20:24,880
I just can't wait to get out of here.

715
0:20:24,880 --> 0:20:26,920
This place sucks a lot, I'm not going to lie.

716
0:20:26,920 --> 0:20:30,120
I'm sick and I'm tired and I want to go home.

717
0:20:30,120 --> 0:20:32,800
At this point, the island was making us miserable.

718
0:20:32,800 --> 0:20:35,600
This is quickly turning into a little bit of a nightmare.

719
0:20:35,600 --> 0:20:37,920
And after six days of physical struggle,

720
0:20:37,920 --> 0:20:40,400
our mental health was beginning to suffer as well.

721
0:20:40,400 --> 0:20:42,960
There's only so much bagged food you can drink

722
0:20:42,960 --> 0:20:46,000
and hours you can lay in the sun before you

723
0:20:46,000 --> 0:20:47,440
start to just feel terrible.

724
0:20:47,440 --> 0:20:48,720
And I'm starting to feel terrible.

725
0:20:48,720 --> 0:20:49,560
I have a headache.

726
0:20:49,560 --> 0:20:50,560
I am very tired.

727
0:20:50,560 --> 0:20:52,200
It was clear that we were going to have

728
0:20:52,200 --> 0:20:54,360
to take drastic measures if we were going

729
0:20:54,360 --> 0:20:55,560
to complete this challenge.

730
0:20:55,560 --> 0:20:56,800
Looking for a peach cobbler.

731
0:20:56,800 --> 0:20:58,560
Want to look for a peach cobbler?

732
0:20:58,560 --> 0:20:59,200
Oh, I found one.

733
0:20:59,200 --> 0:21:01,320
So in an effort to turn things around,

734
0:21:01,320 --> 0:21:03,880
we treated ourselves to canned cobbler for breakfast.

735
0:21:03,880 --> 0:21:04,480
Pretty good.

736
0:21:04,480 --> 0:21:04,880
I'm out.

737
0:21:04,880 --> 0:21:06,440
Yeah, for a can.

738
0:21:06,440 --> 0:21:08,680
And with the help of this unorthodox breakfast.

739
0:21:08,680 --> 0:21:09,360
Can that happen?

740
0:21:09,360 --> 0:21:11,440
We were beginning to return back to normal.

741
0:21:11,440 --> 0:21:13,600
Go ahead.

742
0:21:13,600 --> 0:21:15,120
Dude, you hit right into the tree.

743
0:21:15,120 --> 0:21:17,120
And it became clear how exactly we

744
0:21:17,120 --> 0:21:22,000
were going to survive day six by having fun with each other.

745
0:21:22,000 --> 0:21:26,160
And I began to realize, even though we've all

746
0:21:26,160 --> 0:21:27,280
done a lot of suffering.

747
0:21:27,280 --> 0:21:29,840
Why'd we pick the heaviest seat in existence?

748
0:21:29,840 --> 0:21:32,200
This whole trip has been filled with a lot of fun.

749
0:21:32,200 --> 0:21:33,000
Cheers, boys.

750
0:21:33,000 --> 0:21:33,720
And adventure.

751
0:21:33,720 --> 0:21:35,120
We did it.

752
0:21:35,120 --> 0:21:37,960
Moments like these are hard to find.

753
0:21:37,960 --> 0:21:39,880
And when I look back on this challenge,

754
0:21:39,880 --> 0:21:43,440
we probably won't remember the bad times as much

755
0:21:43,440 --> 0:21:45,840
as we will the good.

756
0:21:45,840 --> 0:21:48,800
It's kind of cool.

757
0:21:48,800 --> 0:21:52,760
And with day six of our challenge finally coming to an end,

758
0:21:52,760 --> 0:21:57,560
we're celebrating our final night with a massive fire.

759
0:21:57,560 --> 0:21:59,040
But it's kind of burning us all.

760
0:21:59,040 --> 0:21:59,760
Yeah, I'm getting mad.

761
0:21:59,760 --> 0:22:00,960
It's a little too big.

762
0:22:00,960 --> 0:22:04,680
When we wake up tomorrow, the challenge will be over.

763
0:22:04,680 --> 0:22:07,400
And as the sun rose on day seven,

764
0:22:07,400 --> 0:22:09,000
we broke down camp and cleaned up

765
0:22:09,040 --> 0:22:14,000
with one thing in mind, leaving this place and never coming back.

766
0:22:14,000 --> 0:22:16,760
And before we leave, I just want to take the time to say,

767
0:22:16,760 --> 0:22:18,440
thank you all for watching.

768
0:22:18,440 --> 0:22:21,440
All of you are the only reason videos like this exist.

769
0:22:21,440 --> 0:22:24,520
And I really hope you all enjoyed it.
