1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:05,760
I've built a massive isolation chamber and we're gonna see if these two

2
0:00:05,760 --> 0:00:10,400
strangers can survive in this chamber for the next 100 days. They have never

3
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:14,760
met each other ever. Bailey, this is Susie. Susie, this is Bailey.

4
0:00:14,760 --> 0:00:18,880
Nice to meet you. Hi, nice to meet you. If the two of you can survive the next 100

5
0:00:18,880 --> 0:00:22,480
days in here, I will give you the half a million dollars inside of this bowl.

6
0:00:22,480 --> 0:00:26,520
But if one of you leaves before the hundred days is up, you both get

7
0:00:26,520 --> 0:00:32,160
nothing. All right, I think you guys understand the rules. Have fun. Okay, bye.

8
0:00:32,160 --> 0:00:36,080
This is gonna be crazy.

9
0:00:39,120 --> 0:00:44,400
Yeah. This is actually like an insane asylum. They're currently looking at all

10
0:00:44,400 --> 0:00:47,400
the stuff we put in there. We gave them enough food for 100 days. Which is healthy

11
0:00:47,400 --> 0:00:51,500
but basically the exact same thing over and over again. We also gave them

12
0:00:51,500 --> 0:00:54,960
their own private bathroom which comes with a shower and obviously has no

13
0:00:54,960 --> 0:00:58,440
cameras inside and a bed to sleep on. They have everything they need to survive

14
0:00:58,440 --> 0:01:02,760
100 days. It's just a question of do they want it? I got a comb. I don't know if I've

15
0:01:02,760 --> 0:01:07,440
ever combed my hair in my life. Interesting. See how they're both standing on

16
0:01:07,440 --> 0:01:10,520
different sides of the room? They're so awkward. When I had them take their

17
0:01:10,520 --> 0:01:16,080
blindfolds off, that was legitimately the first time they had ever met. I just

18
0:01:16,080 --> 0:01:23,040
keep thinking of the feeling, like, of exiting. Oh yeah. How good is that gonna feel?

19
0:01:25,120 --> 0:01:29,720
It's only 100 sleeps. Only 100 sleeps. And then the world will have just kept

20
0:01:29,720 --> 0:01:35,000
going. That's like what freaks me out. The most interesting part of this

21
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:39,320
experiment is that in this room you have no idea what day or time it is.

22
0:01:39,320 --> 0:01:43,240
And already on night one, Susie and Bailey made the mistake of only

23
0:01:43,240 --> 0:01:48,960
sleeping for two hours. Which means they started their second day at 2.37 a.m.

24
0:01:48,960 --> 0:01:52,960
I'm just gonna just act like this is just the new normal. Okay, what do you want to eat?

25
0:01:52,960 --> 0:01:58,400
Are you feeling beef or chicken? Mm, chicken. Chicken sounds great.

26
0:02:02,840 --> 0:02:08,200
It's good. As you can see, living inside a white cube is pretty boring.

27
0:02:08,200 --> 0:02:11,960
Besides eating the same thing over and over, time in the chamber consisted of

28
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:16,520
two things. Trying to hide from the bright lights. The lights are just so bright that

29
0:02:16,520 --> 0:02:20,440
we have to make these things to shield ourselves. And desperate attempts to keep

30
0:02:20,440 --> 0:02:24,120
themselves entertained. Like on day four when they used the paper from their

31
0:02:24,120 --> 0:02:28,840
journals to make a deck of playing cards. Is he making a card? Alright, so I just

32
0:02:28,840 --> 0:02:31,400
finished my deck of cards. I think that they actually came out alright. Which

33
0:02:31,400 --> 0:02:35,840
honestly looked pretty fun. So I made myself a $30,000 seat and joined in.

34
0:02:35,840 --> 0:02:44,720
On day five they made a sign-in sheet, which was really just an elaborate trip.

35
0:02:44,720 --> 0:02:48,480
What is this? You have to sign our sign-in sheet. Oh, these are our camera people.

36
0:02:48,480 --> 0:02:52,080
Yeah, this is everyone that's come in today. Wait a minute. You're having them

37
0:02:52,080 --> 0:02:56,680
do this so you can track the date and the time. Hold on, I need to borrow this.

38
0:02:56,680 --> 0:03:00,560
No, no, no, I wrote the date. I wrote the date. Which I gotta say was pretty smart.

39
0:03:00,560 --> 0:03:04,760
But by the time we got to day seven, anything considered smart was thrown out

40
0:03:04,760 --> 0:03:12,680
the window. Bailey's lost it. He's whipping the pork. Yeah, I bet he's

41
0:03:12,680 --> 0:03:19,440
there to stand a chance. Five more throws. But I only need one. Well, it's freaking

42
0:03:19,440 --> 0:03:23,840
go baby. It's actually crazy to me that already on day nine of this challenge

43
0:03:23,840 --> 0:03:28,000
they're bored enough to expose the red line. That if they cross they lose

44
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:33,480
every dollar of their prize money. It is now day number 10. How you doing Nolan?

45
0:03:33,520 --> 0:03:36,480
Good. And I got a pretty interesting offer.

46
0:03:39,480 --> 0:03:44,920
So it looks like they took the $500,000 and put 250 on her side and 250 on his to

47
0:03:44,920 --> 0:03:49,280
remind themselves of what's at stake. The whole door opening thing is so

48
0:03:49,280 --> 0:03:52,880
dramatic. How's it going? We're about to reveal the most interesting part of

49
0:03:52,880 --> 0:03:56,880
the challenge. I need you two to just face this wall. They don't even know that

50
0:03:56,880 --> 0:03:59,240
there's a door back here. Let's do this.

51
0:04:04,480 --> 0:04:11,920
This is our first time seeing the outside world and you are hitting me. The sky.

52
0:04:11,920 --> 0:04:16,040
Every 10 days I will give you something that will make the challenge easier but

53
0:04:16,040 --> 0:04:19,360
if you actually want it you'll have to pay for it with some of your prize money.

54
0:04:19,360 --> 0:04:23,000
And first for day 10 we're gonna give you the option to buy a private chef.

55
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,200
They'll cook you whatever you want between now and the end of the

56
0:04:25,200 --> 0:04:29,240
challenge for $50,000. Before you answer if you want to give up some of your

57
0:04:29,240 --> 0:04:32,320
prize money we're gonna let you have a nice meal. Use this as a flaw for

58
0:04:32,360 --> 0:04:36,160
your imagination as to what you could be eating for 90 more days.

59
0:04:36,160 --> 0:04:40,920
You are kidding me. $50,000 a lot though. Let's not think about it right now.

60
0:04:40,920 --> 0:04:43,960
These look like some people that have only eaten canned chicken for 10 days.

61
0:04:43,960 --> 0:04:48,560
I love just looking at the sky. You forget that they literally haven't seen the

62
0:04:48,560 --> 0:04:53,360
sun in 10 days. No I feel bad. After eating this the thought of that food is

63
0:04:53,360 --> 0:04:57,040
like grossing me out even worse. They're starting to talk about whether

64
0:04:57,040 --> 0:05:00,920
they should take it. I don't know what to do. This is a good first one

65
0:05:00,920 --> 0:05:06,160
to tempt us with. Oh no. Hey Jimmy. All right. It's time for the decision.

66
0:05:06,160 --> 0:05:12,480
Would you pay $50,000 to have this for the rest of the challenge? Nope. I think we

67
0:05:12,480 --> 0:05:18,360
decided no. Really? I honestly didn't think you guys would say no. Oh my god.

68
0:05:18,360 --> 0:05:22,680
I have another offer in 10 days. We'll see if you came then. I really thought

69
0:05:22,680 --> 0:05:26,600
you were gonna say yes. That was crazy. Bye. I'm really curious what

70
0:05:26,640 --> 0:05:30,560
the next temptation is though. I know. But you know what? I'm proud of us for

71
0:05:30,560 --> 0:05:34,920
staying strong. Good job. And now with the chef gone it seemed like Susie and Bailey

72
0:05:34,920 --> 0:05:38,760
were already starting to regret their decision. Bon appetit. My favorite part

73
0:05:38,760 --> 0:05:43,440
is that you can hold it sideways and it stays on the plate. The next few days

74
0:05:43,440 --> 0:05:46,560
were pretty mind-numbing for the both of them. Their routine consisted of

75
0:05:46,560 --> 0:05:50,200
waking up, cooking food and then eventually just going back to sleep.

76
0:05:50,200 --> 0:05:53,680
Man. The longer I'm in here the more I feel like I'm sharing a space

77
0:05:53,760 --> 0:05:59,760
with an annoying sibling. I'm talking about me. Who else? And even though they

78
0:05:59,760 --> 0:06:02,960
were getting used to each other, one thing they weren't getting used to were

79
0:06:02,960 --> 0:06:06,280
the constant beaming lights. It's just so bright in there. I came to the

80
0:06:06,280 --> 0:06:10,160
bathroom because the light you can keep it off so it's nice and like dark in

81
0:06:10,160 --> 0:06:14,920
here. Once it gets super late at night I physically feel my eyes stinging

82
0:06:14,920 --> 0:06:18,800
just because of how bright the lights are in here. And because it was so

83
0:06:18,800 --> 0:06:22,240
hard for them to get any sleep I had the perfect offer planned for day

84
0:06:22,360 --> 0:06:30,640
20. Congrats. You're 20% done. Are you two ready for the offer? Yeah. Your day

85
0:06:30,640 --> 0:06:34,160
20 offer is simple. I will give you each a smart bed that are super

86
0:06:34,160 --> 0:06:38,280
comfortable and combined will cost $50,000 of your prize money. I will also

87
0:06:38,280 --> 0:06:42,880
give you this iPad with the ability to turn off the lights. Dang. They have

88
0:06:42,880 --> 0:06:46,760
exactly one hour to decide if they want to spend $50,000 of their prize

89
0:06:46,760 --> 0:06:49,800
money for these beds and the ability to turn off the lights. The answer

90
0:06:49,840 --> 0:06:54,080
might be yes. I haven't seen Susie this happy since we literally started the

91
0:06:54,080 --> 0:06:57,360
challenge. Let's remember what we would have to live with if we don't say

92
0:06:57,360 --> 0:07:05,800
yes. Oh my gosh. I think they're going to take it. I think we should. It's

93
0:07:05,800 --> 0:07:12,080
only 10% of our money. It's decision time. You're one hours up. This is

94
0:07:12,080 --> 0:07:15,360
what your eyeballs could have but if you say no this is what you're

95
0:07:15,360 --> 0:07:19,480
stuck with. For 80 days straight do you want these comfortable beds? I'm

96
0:07:19,520 --> 0:07:27,320
actually okay with whatever you say. Five, four, three, two, one. What's your

97
0:07:27,320 --> 0:07:39,680
decision? No. Really? Okay. Whoa. I did not see that one coming. I think I made

98
0:07:39,680 --> 0:07:44,920
a mistake maybe. Oh, what a heavy mistake. I cannot believe you guys said no. I'll

99
0:07:44,920 --> 0:07:47,280
leave you alone for a couple of days. I hope you don't regret your

100
0:07:47,320 --> 0:07:52,720
decision. Bye. Bye. I think we made the right decision. I can't believe that in

101
0:07:52,720 --> 0:07:57,440
the heat of the moment you said no. Oh, I feel that slight regret right now. I

102
0:07:57,440 --> 0:08:05,280
don't. I feel no regret in your decision. So today I made my calendar and I

103
0:08:05,280 --> 0:08:09,480
was just writing my mom's birthday. It's going to be tough on that day I

104
0:08:09,480 --> 0:08:19,680
think. I'm so bored. I think that we're hitting a point where boredom is at like

105
0:08:19,680 --> 0:08:23,880
the all-time high. I woke up this morning and didn't feel like doing anything so I

106
0:08:23,880 --> 0:08:29,600
just sat there and stared. What are you going to do with this money? I have a

107
0:08:29,600 --> 0:08:33,400
house. I was probably gonna pay a lot on the house. Oh, that's awesome. I want to

108
0:08:33,400 --> 0:08:37,600
pay off my parents' debt. That would be like my ideal world. Throughout the

109
0:08:37,640 --> 0:08:41,320
following days I made sure to not interrupt the routine. However, I was

110
0:08:41,320 --> 0:08:45,400
also taking note of things they missed from the outside world. Like on day 24

111
0:08:45,400 --> 0:08:48,880
when I overheard them wanting seasoning on their food. Okay, if we had

112
0:08:48,880 --> 0:08:54,280
seasoning, I could easily stay here a hundred days. On day 27, Susie was

113
0:08:54,280 --> 0:08:59,760
craving coffee. I am a big coffee drinker and I only have water. And on day

114
0:08:59,760 --> 0:09:07,400
28 Bailey clearly needed entertainment. So by day 30 I had the perfect plan to

115
0:09:07,440 --> 0:09:11,240
get them to spend money. It's now day 30. It's time for another offer. How's it

116
0:09:11,240 --> 0:09:16,680
going? Hi. Today's offer is simple. Each of these five items cost $10,000. You can

117
0:09:16,680 --> 0:09:20,480
buy one phone call, the entire Harry Potter collection, your own coffee

118
0:09:20,480 --> 0:09:24,240
machine, spices, salt and pepper for your food or you can buy a monopoly for

119
0:09:24,240 --> 0:09:27,600
$10,000. You can buy one of them. You can buy all five of them. This is

120
0:09:27,600 --> 0:09:30,520
tough actually. Do you have 10 minutes to decide? Just let me know what

121
0:09:30,520 --> 0:09:34,760
you want. I'm so nervous. This is a big decision. Coffee. Oh, it does sound

122
0:09:34,800 --> 0:09:39,000
kind of nice. It does. And then the seasoning. Seasoning sounds nice too. I'm

123
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,720
doing this one 1,000%. I'll be honest with you. I don't really care about that.

124
0:09:42,760 --> 0:09:47,480
Sick. Coffee would be nice. It's like a treat every morning. I've made my mind

125
0:09:47,480 --> 0:09:54,760
up. Decision time. Are you buying monopoly? No. Gone. Are you buying the

126
0:09:54,760 --> 0:10:00,720
spices? No. No. Are you buying the coffee? Does it come with cream or

127
0:10:00,720 --> 0:10:08,560
sugar? If you say yes in three seconds. Yes. Okay. Are you buying the Harry

128
0:10:08,560 --> 0:10:16,440
Potter books? Yes. Are you buying the phone calls? No. We finally got you two to

129
0:10:16,440 --> 0:10:20,400
buy something. This feels good. It was a pleasure doing business. Thanks for

130
0:10:20,400 --> 0:10:24,360
taking your money. Most expensive coffee maker in the world. 30 days in, we

131
0:10:24,360 --> 0:10:27,640
got something new. That's exciting. We caved you're welcome. That's my

132
0:10:27,720 --> 0:10:31,720
closet. That's my bookshelf. I could stay another 70 days easy. And we still

133
0:10:31,720 --> 0:10:36,920
have $480,000. That's crazy. Over the next few days, not a lot happened. She's

134
0:10:36,920 --> 0:10:40,240
already preparing a meal. It's like being married. The most interesting thing

135
0:10:40,240 --> 0:10:46,240
was when Hurricane Idaalia took out the power on day 34. Oh, no way. No way. As

136
0:10:46,240 --> 0:10:50,600
you can imagine, our cameras became pretty useless. So I'm just gonna take

137
0:10:50,600 --> 0:10:55,840
you to day 39. How's it going? Hello. Hey. I know you guys have been

138
0:10:55,840 --> 0:11:02,400
struggling. I'm sorry it took so long. Hold up. Oh, there we go. That was a long

139
0:11:02,400 --> 0:11:06,320
delay. You should be able to use your coffee pot again, cook food. You should

140
0:11:06,320 --> 0:11:09,520
have hot shower. That's excellent. I'll see you tomorrow with a surprise. Oh, I'm

141
0:11:09,520 --> 0:11:15,560
so excited. Yay. The power's on. Look, it's light. It feels like cheerier. The

142
0:11:15,560 --> 0:11:21,480
lights are back on again. I just had a hot meal, hot shower. Life is

143
0:11:21,600 --> 0:11:29,000
finally looking up here. It is now day 40. Can I come in? Come in. Your gift at no

144
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:34,800
expense is this TV. But every single movie is $10,000 a pop. You have one hour to

145
0:11:34,800 --> 0:11:38,600
decide. Have fun. This is crazy the amount of movies in here. We could watch this

146
0:11:38,600 --> 0:11:43,760
documentary about Nolan. We left Suzy and Bailey to discuss the offer and told

147
0:11:43,760 --> 0:11:46,800
them we'd be back later, but they didn't seem too interested. How about

148
0:11:46,840 --> 0:11:51,520
$10,000 for all? I'll go ahead and tell you now. No. You might as well just come in

149
0:11:51,520 --> 0:11:57,720
here because I think we both are set in our ways. Okay, the best I could do is buy

150
0:11:57,720 --> 0:12:03,720
one, get one half off. Can't do it. All right gang, come on in. Take every last

151
0:12:03,720 --> 0:12:09,120
one. I'll gladly keep this. Oh, not any of the Hunger Games. I left the TV in

152
0:12:09,120 --> 0:12:11,920
the chamber to remind Suzy and Bailey of what they could have had, but

153
0:12:11,920 --> 0:12:15,080
little did I know they were gonna outsmart me. And in 10 is just a

154
0:12:15,080 --> 0:12:20,280
piece of metal. Rip this little wire off the wall. So I had to take this knife so

155
0:12:20,280 --> 0:12:23,720
that the wire is like frayed. I literally just plugged it into the

156
0:12:23,720 --> 0:12:27,560
intended spot. Now we're gonna see if it works. Just anything. Give us one

157
0:12:27,560 --> 0:12:33,360
channel. Oh, what? It says that there's seven digital channels. Oh my gosh. If this

158
0:12:33,360 --> 0:12:40,200
actually works, wait. I'm like actually shaking. Bailey! Currently the only

159
0:12:40,200 --> 0:12:43,160
thing that we can get on the TV is a race car race. I've never really been

160
0:12:43,160 --> 0:12:47,920
a fan. I know he's in second. But today, all of a sudden, we're huge race car

161
0:12:47,920 --> 0:12:53,600
fans. Our time's gonna fly by. And Suzy was right because for the next six days,

162
0:12:53,600 --> 0:13:00,240
that's all they did. Having the TV feels like we're in purgatory. It's like

163
0:13:00,240 --> 0:13:05,040
almost normal life. It is my mom's birthday tomorrow. Even though I won't

164
0:13:05,040 --> 0:13:08,880
be able to spend the day with her, I got some time in here to make her a

165
0:13:08,880 --> 0:13:12,280
little birthday present. Although I didn't go out and buy something, I'm

166
0:13:12,320 --> 0:13:17,480
technically spending money on it. Tomorrow is day 50, so I'm gonna use toilet

167
0:13:17,480 --> 0:13:27,520
paper to do streamers and decorate the room. It's day 50. Oh. Oh, hey. What do you

168
0:13:27,520 --> 0:13:32,000
think your surprise is today? I have no idea. This one is a very big one. All

169
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:35,560
right, so the offer for day 50 is $20,000 for the both of you to see

170
0:13:35,560 --> 0:13:38,360
your families. They're in the other room watching that feed and they can

171
0:13:38,360 --> 0:13:42,440
hear everything we're saying. Hey, I miss you guys. I love you. I miss you. I'll be

172
0:13:42,440 --> 0:13:45,640
back in 10 minutes to hear if you're gonna take the offer. Good luck. 10

173
0:13:45,640 --> 0:13:48,840
minutes. This feels like a pretty easy decision. What are your thoughts? Oh my

174
0:13:48,840 --> 0:13:51,800
gosh, I don't know. This might be the only chance in this challenge to see

175
0:13:51,800 --> 0:13:54,720
them until the end. I think it's a no-brainer personally, so it's up to

176
0:13:54,720 --> 0:13:58,760
you if we spend $20,000 for both. Of course, I want to see my parents too.

177
0:13:58,760 --> 0:14:04,040
He's a yes and she's a no-brainer. Mom, Dad, tell me what to do. All right.

178
0:14:04,040 --> 0:14:06,720
What are you thinking? Where are you guys at? He's been a yes from the

179
0:14:06,760 --> 0:14:10,800
beginning. As soon as you said it. About 10 seconds left. But it's my mom's

180
0:14:10,800 --> 0:14:13,840
birthday today and we're saying yes. All right, give me $20,000 and I'll go

181
0:14:13,840 --> 0:14:18,320
get them. Best 10K I've ever spent, I think. Okay, they's paid the 20 grand.

182
0:14:18,320 --> 0:14:20,280
Come on in. I'm so excited.

183
0:14:20,280 --> 0:14:21,280
Yay!

184
0:14:21,280 --> 0:14:33,280
I made you a birthday. And to celebrate her birthday, we brought a birthday cake.

185
0:14:34,240 --> 0:14:40,760
This is the best tasty thing they've had in forever. It's little things like that

186
0:14:40,760 --> 0:14:46,760
that you don't realize you won't have until you're in it. Bye!

187
0:14:46,760 --> 0:14:52,480
That's the worst feeling so far. The highest of highs and now back to our

188
0:14:52,480 --> 0:14:57,080
little cube all alone. Like I said earlier, the things we're offering them are

189
0:14:57,080 --> 0:15:00,520
based off of what we're overhearing them talk about in the cube. So you

190
0:15:00,560 --> 0:15:03,560
better believe that when Susie said this. Probably the only thing I'd say yes to

191
0:15:03,560 --> 0:15:07,560
at this point is like if they do Tesla. You already know on day 60, I knew

192
0:15:07,560 --> 0:15:12,280
exactly what to surprise them with. How's it going? Hi! Oh hey, first things first,

193
0:15:12,280 --> 0:15:16,440
I brought you a giant mystery gift. Yay! Do the two of you want to spend

194
0:15:16,440 --> 0:15:22,000
$50,000 to keep what's inside of this box? Hmm. Is either gonna be the best

195
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:24,760
moment of their life or the worst moment? Just give me your answer in an

196
0:15:24,760 --> 0:15:28,640
hour. All right, thanks. We'll be thanking. 59 minutes remain. I think we

197
0:15:28,680 --> 0:15:32,720
should. I know. I think it might be worth it. Imagine it is something great we

198
0:15:32,720 --> 0:15:36,880
said no. Would it ever be a car? Well, it could be. Could actually be the keys to a

199
0:15:36,880 --> 0:15:40,840
car. It's not gonna be equal to the value that we're spending. She's right. It's

200
0:15:40,840 --> 0:15:44,840
almost three times more. I don't feel confident in the yes. Then let's say no.

201
0:15:44,840 --> 0:15:48,800
But are you sure? Yeah. If you're not confident. I just know they would

202
0:15:48,800 --> 0:15:52,000
never do a car. Yeah they would. Really? And I feel like they could do

203
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:55,440
anything. Let's just say no. Wait, now you have me wanting to say yes.

204
0:15:56,400 --> 0:16:02,400
Decision time. Okay. Do you want to spend $50,000 to keep what's inside this box?

205
0:16:02,400 --> 0:16:10,560
Yes or no? No. Really? What is your answer? I'm going with no. Really? Yeah. I can't

206
0:16:10,560 --> 0:16:15,800
believe you guys didn't take it. Do you want to unlock it? Sure. All right.

207
0:16:15,800 --> 0:16:21,080
Inside is $50,000, so you would have got your money back. And then you want

208
0:16:21,080 --> 0:16:26,160
to open up that stack of money? Just grab that. Here is a Tesla key for you and a

209
0:16:26,160 --> 0:16:31,720
Tesla key for you. I'm so sorry. They would have gotten their money back plus

210
0:16:31,720 --> 0:16:38,120
these two Teslas for free. Oh, I want to cry. Let's close this. That's really my

211
0:16:38,120 --> 0:16:45,560
dream. We're gonna head out. You leave the beef. Thank you. Bye. That's wild.

212
0:16:45,880 --> 0:16:51,780
Bailey. They got us Teslas. I feel like we made the wrong decision. By all

213
0:16:51,780 --> 0:16:58,820
we're growth this forever. Nah. Yeah, I will. Oh no, it's all a dream. I like my

214
0:16:58,820 --> 0:17:04,960
Prius. Okay, there I said it. And after getting hit hard by yesterday's offer,

215
0:17:04,960 --> 0:17:09,480
Susie literally whined about the Tesla for nine days straight. It's really

216
0:17:09,480 --> 0:17:12,760
hard to see the positive in all this. I like actually won't be able to sleep.

217
0:17:12,760 --> 0:17:20,960
I'm actually feeling sick right now. I'm so mad. Susie's taking it hard. And so to

218
0:17:20,960 --> 0:17:26,480
make up for it, I made sure this next offer was the best one yet. It's day 70.

219
0:17:26,480 --> 0:17:30,760
Today's a big day because this is the last offer. So obviously on day 80, you're

220
0:17:30,760 --> 0:17:33,640
gonna be like, there's only 20 days left. And on day 90, you're gonna be like, why

221
0:17:33,640 --> 0:17:36,480
would we spend money? There's 10 days left, correct? Yeah. Let me just open

222
0:17:36,480 --> 0:17:40,160
the doors. Oh, God. No shot you reject. This offer. What you see here is

223
0:17:40,200 --> 0:17:44,440
everything you said no to so far in this challenge. Before I tell them the price tag,

224
0:17:44,440 --> 0:17:47,080
I'm gonna move everything in here. I'm gonna make it as easy as possible from

225
0:17:47,080 --> 0:17:52,680
the CES. Nolan, Chris, put those by the TV. Oh. As much as I love to bully Nolan,

226
0:17:52,680 --> 0:17:58,520
he's just dumb. Here's a bet. If you guys say no, we have to move all of this

227
0:17:58,520 --> 0:18:02,240
back out. Well, then give us a good price. What you are considering buying

228
0:18:02,240 --> 0:18:06,840
is these two $30,000 beds. A brand new mystery box. This one doesn't have

229
0:18:06,880 --> 0:18:12,520
$50,000 inside. It has something else. Sounds like $25,000. One phone called each,

230
0:18:12,520 --> 0:18:18,880
Spices Monopoly. Every single movie in the Walmart movie. And lastly, the cook you

231
0:18:18,880 --> 0:18:23,160
said no to. Oh, there is a plate of food. I see a lot of good food. And to remind

232
0:18:23,160 --> 0:18:27,600
you how good it is, here's some chicken alfredo. That looks so good. It's time

233
0:18:27,600 --> 0:18:31,560
to find out how much this will cost you. Behind these curtains is a number.

234
0:18:31,560 --> 0:18:35,120
If you bid higher than that number, you get everything here for the rest of

235
0:18:35,160 --> 0:18:40,240
the challenge. But if you say $1, one penny lower, you get nothing. I'll give

236
0:18:40,240 --> 0:18:44,120
you an hour to figure out your bid. I'm thinking, what if it's like way low? And

237
0:18:44,120 --> 0:18:49,000
they want us to say $150,000. I think if we bid $75,000, that would be too

238
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:52,200
little. They're thinking at least $100,000. I actually feel like we

239
0:18:52,200 --> 0:18:54,800
should go a little bit lower because we were prepared to say no to it.

240
0:18:54,800 --> 0:18:57,800
That's true, but are you prepared to walk away with nothing? And while

241
0:18:57,800 --> 0:19:00,560
they're deciding what to do, I want to tell you about the Shop App. The

242
0:19:00,560 --> 0:19:04,520
Shop App is the best way to shop on your phone. And it's completely free.

243
0:19:04,640 --> 0:19:07,560
It'll basically look at everything you're interested in and recommend you

244
0:19:07,560 --> 0:19:10,880
products you love. This is the only wild card because we know what beds are and

245
0:19:10,880 --> 0:19:13,880
we know what movies are. We don't know what's in here. I have a feeling I want

246
0:19:13,880 --> 0:19:19,040
whatever is inside. It's actually a third contestant. And when you're ready

247
0:19:19,040 --> 0:19:23,720
to buy, you can speed through checkout using Shop Pay. Let's do this. $80,000

248
0:19:23,720 --> 0:19:26,840
101. Because it's day 70. I don't want to go under 70. I feel like this

249
0:19:26,840 --> 0:19:30,800
is like gives us space. I get what you're saying, but imagine that was

250
0:19:30,800 --> 0:19:34,680
the reason why we didn't end up getting all this. I would be so sad.

251
0:19:37,560 --> 0:19:40,960
Shop App will even track all your packages in one place so you don't know

252
0:19:40,960 --> 0:19:45,080
exactly when they'll arrive for the holidays. $100,000 and $100.

253
0:19:45,080 --> 0:19:46,360
Yeah, it's not really that much damage.

254
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:50,240
This is it. This is the one. Ready? Official. All right. We're flipping it.

255
0:19:51,400 --> 0:19:54,600
I hope we get it. Let the Shop App AI Assistant scan hundreds of

256
0:19:54,600 --> 0:19:57,520
millions of products all over the Shop App to recommend the perfect

257
0:19:57,520 --> 0:20:02,160
gifts for this holiday season. Time is up. What's the number? Let me see it.

258
0:20:02,160 --> 0:20:05,320
Before you do, make sure you download the Shop App right now if you haven't

259
0:20:05,320 --> 0:20:07,800
already. I explained all the benefits of it. It's a beautiful, amazing app.

260
0:20:07,800 --> 0:20:11,560
Download the Shop App. Okay, what is your bid? If it's $1 below mine,

261
0:20:11,560 --> 0:20:16,640
you get nothing. $100,101. Chandler, reveal it.

262
0:20:19,400 --> 0:20:25,200
$60,000. You overpaid by $30,000. I don't care.

263
0:20:26,200 --> 0:20:31,320
Yo, this is the most excited I've been so far. In this mystery box, which I did

264
0:20:31,320 --> 0:20:37,600
clarify was different. It's two smaller Teslas. No, I love this. I'll be teaming

265
0:20:37,600 --> 0:20:41,240
up with the Shop App to grant thousands of wishes this holiday season. I'll tell

266
0:20:41,240 --> 0:20:44,960
you more about it at the end of the video. A room feels drastically different

267
0:20:44,960 --> 0:20:48,600
right now. It's a dream. We now have so many things to do. It's like a

268
0:20:48,600 --> 0:20:52,680
vacation. It's an investment for sure. I think it was well worth $100,000.

269
0:20:52,920 --> 0:20:56,480
You may think, oh, the challenge is over now, but one of them may lose everything.

270
0:20:56,480 --> 0:21:00,680
You'll see on day 99 what I'm talking about. Oh my God, this is crazy. Now, you would

271
0:21:00,680 --> 0:21:04,280
think that getting all this stuff would make both of them a lot happier, but

272
0:21:04,280 --> 0:21:07,680
strangely enough, the opposite actually started to happen.

273
0:21:10,600 --> 0:21:14,840
One thing I took for granted on the outside was a hot shower that I also

274
0:21:14,840 --> 0:21:19,600
did not share with anyone. A hot water tank here runs out so quickly and

275
0:21:19,640 --> 0:21:23,560
Bailey always showers before me. So I've been stuck showering with cold water

276
0:21:23,560 --> 0:21:27,240
for honestly a couple months now. We've been playing the same monopoly game for

277
0:21:27,240 --> 0:21:32,000
like seven days because Susie refuses to play. Like maybe she just hates board

278
0:21:32,000 --> 0:21:35,920
games. I think we need to take like three days and cram as many movies as we

279
0:21:35,920 --> 0:21:39,240
can. All she ever does is read or watch movies. We got to have like a movie

280
0:21:39,240 --> 0:21:42,040
marathon. So whenever I'm like, can we just finish that game? She's like,

281
0:21:42,040 --> 0:21:44,640
yeah, yeah, yeah. And then it never ends up happening. It's impossible to

282
0:21:44,640 --> 0:21:50,480
get her to focus. Hey, do you want to watch the notebook later? No, I don't

283
0:21:50,480 --> 0:21:53,440
want to watch the notebook later. We just spent the last like 25 minutes

284
0:21:53,440 --> 0:21:55,800
trying to choose a movie and Susie, what did you say you're about to go

285
0:21:55,800 --> 0:22:04,280
do? Shower. She literally does this all the time. Bailey is wired right

286
0:22:04,280 --> 0:22:08,000
now. This happens literally every morning. He's just nonstop, so

287
0:22:08,000 --> 0:22:11,160
energetic all the time. I just had to come in here because I can't go

288
0:22:11,160 --> 0:22:15,600
anywhere else. That's a rave right there. Bailey, it's 3 a.m. Yeah, but

289
0:22:15,600 --> 0:22:31,480
sometimes you got to rave. Get me out of here. Do you want to play Monopoly? No. Do you know where the dice are? Yeah. I

290
0:22:31,480 --> 0:22:36,360
hid them because you keep asking me to play. So I was like, maybe if I just hide

291
0:22:36,360 --> 0:22:47,640
them, then we'll never be able to play. Your toes look so long. No, that's

292
0:22:47,640 --> 0:22:58,120
sickening. My dogs are barking. I would like to be saved. I'm ready to leave. Even though

293
0:22:58,120 --> 0:23:01,480
at this point they could hardly stand each other. With the in so close, they

294
0:23:01,480 --> 0:23:05,440
set their differences aside and counted down the days. Four days left. Three.

295
0:23:05,880 --> 0:23:14,000
And Bailey, well. It's going to be really couldn't wait to walk out those doors. I wasn't in the

296
0:23:14,000 --> 0:23:19,560
middle of saying anything. All right, day 99. For me, it feels like it's been

297
0:23:19,560 --> 0:23:22,960
honestly an entire year. I can't imagine what they're feeling. I have to brush

298
0:23:22,960 --> 0:23:31,240
my teeth one more time. Ever. 24 hours remain. This many. Yes. So this is the

299
0:23:31,240 --> 0:23:37,600
first second of the challenge when you've all walked in. Oh my gosh. I feel like

300
0:23:37,600 --> 0:23:44,240
I look like a fetus. Come on in gentlemen. Sign it up right above the door. You

301
0:23:44,240 --> 0:23:49,160
officially have 24 hours left in the challenge. Don't forget what I said. We

302
0:23:49,160 --> 0:23:53,080
got a fun twist for tomorrow. I'm scared. You think they'll still be friends

303
0:23:53,080 --> 0:23:56,560
after this depends what their answer is tomorrow. I'm worried that it's going

304
0:23:56,600 --> 0:24:00,520
to be double or nothing. He's so like quiet about it. You can't guess. Yeah. And

305
0:24:00,520 --> 0:24:03,920
with their final night coming to an end, it was time to present them with an

306
0:24:03,920 --> 0:24:10,560
opportunity to double their money. Hey everyone. This is chaotic. What is going

307
0:24:10,560 --> 0:24:15,480
on? I don't know. Big boy. I want to help but not really. They're literally just

308
0:24:15,480 --> 0:24:20,400
taking everything. Do you know what these are? Those are our blindfolds from the

309
0:24:20,400 --> 0:24:23,280
first day. That was quick. I remember it like it was yesterday. If you would

310
0:24:23,280 --> 0:24:26,720
both please put them back on. Let's see if they want to double their money.

311
0:24:26,720 --> 0:24:32,920
Gang. Oh my gosh. My heart is actually beating out of my chest. 100 days ago

312
0:24:32,920 --> 0:24:36,040
they were strangers. One hour ago they were best friends. Let's see if they

313
0:24:36,040 --> 0:24:41,960
become total enemies. Bailey and Susie take your blindfolds off. So you might

314
0:24:41,960 --> 0:24:45,840
be familiar with what we're about to offer you. You each have the choice

315
0:24:45,840 --> 0:24:50,160
to split the money and nothing changes. You both hit split. You just

316
0:24:50,240 --> 0:24:55,040
split it. Keep what you have. Or if you hit steal, you can steal the other person's

317
0:24:55,040 --> 0:25:01,080
money. And if you both hit steal, you would get nothing. Susie has earplugs in and

318
0:25:01,080 --> 0:25:04,720
noise cancellation headphones on top of them. She can't hear us. Let's go into

319
0:25:04,720 --> 0:25:11,120
your head. I don't even like know. Susie if you pet steal, I can't imagine.

320
0:25:11,120 --> 0:25:14,480
What do you say to somebody that steals 180 whatever? Maybe you get ahead of it

321
0:25:14,480 --> 0:25:18,960
and you steal it. There. You didn't hear that? Bailey actually might. Bailey

322
0:25:19,280 --> 0:25:23,040
might. All right. Throw the music back in his ears. What if while we were over

323
0:25:23,040 --> 0:25:25,440
there, he was like, Oh, this is a no-brainer. It's too much money. We would

324
0:25:25,440 --> 0:25:28,640
never speak again. You guys have become like such close friends. I don't know.

325
0:25:28,640 --> 0:25:32,800
You get to know anyone and when you've gone through the same thing and like

326
0:25:32,800 --> 0:25:36,920
how hard this challenge has been, we both deserve half for sure. But now

327
0:25:36,920 --> 0:25:42,240
you make me nervous. Like I could do it too. Whoa. What did she just say?

328
0:25:42,280 --> 0:25:45,480
Maybe it'll be a case of you think you know someone. I don't know. If

329
0:25:45,480 --> 0:25:48,240
both of them press the steal button, they literally spend a hundred days in

330
0:25:48,240 --> 0:25:51,680
this room together for absolutely nothing. There's 30 seconds left in the

331
0:25:51,680 --> 0:25:56,000
challenge. At the very last second, I want you both to place your vote. Do you

332
0:25:56,000 --> 0:26:00,960
want to walk away with 360 grand or half of it? No one speak. Carl and Chris,

333
0:26:00,960 --> 0:26:04,080
you two don't talk either. I know that Susie is going to split, but the thought

334
0:26:04,080 --> 0:26:10,040
of walking away with almost $360,000, that could do so much. Do you want to

335
0:26:10,040 --> 0:26:13,800
split the money or steal it? The fact that I entered this challenge. Three.

336
0:26:13,960 --> 0:26:19,800
Knowing that there would be pretty dark times ahead. Two. And I still overcame all

337
0:26:19,800 --> 0:26:26,600
those things. One. There's no price you could put on that. No way. If the room

338
0:26:26,600 --> 0:26:31,400
turns red, then someone stole. If the room turns green, then you split the

339
0:26:31,400 --> 0:26:32,400
money.

340
0:26:32,800 --> 0:26:34,200
You both chose split.

341
0:26:37,200 --> 0:26:39,200
Congratulations, that's right.

342
0:26:46,000 --> 0:26:49,200
And like I said earlier in the video, don't forget to double the shop app. If you go on

343
0:26:49,200 --> 0:26:52,000
my store in the shop app, you can tell me whatever you want for the holiday

344
0:26:52,000 --> 0:26:55,600
and I'm going to be fulfilling thousands of wishes. You can say like a Tesla,

345
0:26:55,600 --> 0:26:59,800
U-Gio, cars, beastable cars, doesn't matter. Thank you shop app. I appreciate

346
0:26:59,800 --> 0:27:02,800
you so much and as always, let's blow this place up.
