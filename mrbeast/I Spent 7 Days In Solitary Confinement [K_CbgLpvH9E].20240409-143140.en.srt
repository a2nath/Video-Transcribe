1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:04,320
I'm going to attempt to spend the next seven days in solitary confinement.

2
0:00:04,320 --> 0:00:06,000
Seal me up. Bye Jimmy.

3
0:00:06,000 --> 0:00:07,440
Hopefully I don't go insane.

4
0:00:08,320 --> 0:00:11,760
For the next seven days, I have to survive in this soundproof white room

5
0:00:11,760 --> 0:00:14,560
with zero human contact and zero stimulation.

6
0:00:14,560 --> 0:00:17,360
And because this is actually psychologically dangerous,

7
0:00:17,360 --> 0:00:21,360
the most important thing is the doctor outside making sure I don't go insane.

8
0:00:21,360 --> 0:00:23,600
I worked in psych hospitals for 23 years,

9
0:00:23,600 --> 0:00:26,320
and this is much worse than anything I've ever seen.

10
0:00:26,320 --> 0:00:30,400
Anything past 50 hours in a white room like this can lead to permanent psychological damage.

11
0:00:30,400 --> 0:00:33,040
And I'm about to do 168 hours.

12
0:00:33,040 --> 0:00:37,600
There is a chance that I actually start to lose my mind and go into something called psychosis.

13
0:00:39,600 --> 0:00:42,960
And they have to pull me out because it can cause permanent damage to me.

14
0:00:42,960 --> 0:00:45,760
He survived seven days buried alive. Is this much harder?

15
0:00:45,760 --> 0:00:47,760
Much harder. He doesn't have social contact.

16
0:00:47,760 --> 0:00:50,400
If your brain doesn't have information coming in,

17
0:00:50,400 --> 0:00:54,560
it generates craziness, it generates hallucinations, it generates paranoia.

18
0:00:54,560 --> 0:00:58,000
And all I have to survive for the next week is a bed to sleep on,

19
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:00,880
a notebook with a pen, a refillable bottle of water,

20
0:01:00,880 --> 0:01:03,200
toothbrush with toothpaste, and a bar of soap,

21
0:01:03,200 --> 0:01:05,920
a toilet to use the bathroom and a sink for water.

22
0:01:05,920 --> 0:01:07,200
At this point, it was clear to me,

23
0:01:07,200 --> 0:01:10,160
it was going to be difficult to entertain myself during this challenge,

24
0:01:10,160 --> 0:01:12,560
especially on hour nine when I did this.

25
0:01:12,560 --> 0:01:15,520
You're probably wondering how many tiles are on these walls.

26
0:01:15,520 --> 0:01:17,280
The correct answer is 1900.

27
0:01:17,280 --> 0:01:21,680
And if you want the roof and floor included, then it's 2,860.

28
0:01:21,680 --> 0:01:23,440
But more importantly than all of that,

29
0:01:23,440 --> 0:01:26,080
according to my stomach, it is time to eat food.

30
0:01:26,080 --> 0:01:28,160
If you're wondering how I'm eating during this challenge,

31
0:01:28,160 --> 0:01:31,440
there's a conveyor belt here, which spans over 100 feet,

32
0:01:31,440 --> 0:01:33,680
so I could be fed without any human interaction.

33
0:01:34,560 --> 0:01:36,800
I think I've been in here around 14 hours.

34
0:01:36,800 --> 0:01:40,480
Isn't it crazy that at this point, I was already off by two hours.

35
0:01:40,480 --> 0:01:43,920
And so far the hardest part of the challenge is no one's fed me yet.

36
0:01:43,920 --> 0:01:46,640
In hindsight, I should have ate more food before I came in here.

37
0:01:46,640 --> 0:01:49,840
But yeah, it would be really nice if someone fed me sometime soon.

38
0:01:49,840 --> 0:01:51,040
Your boy is very hungry.

39
0:01:53,440 --> 0:01:54,560
Did you wash your hands?

40
0:01:54,560 --> 0:01:55,520
Yeah, of course I did.

41
0:01:55,520 --> 0:01:56,320
No, he did not.

42
0:01:56,320 --> 0:01:59,200
We'll be sending him his meals randomly so he can't guess the time.

43
0:01:59,200 --> 0:02:01,760
Like it's 6 PM right now and we're sending him his breakfast.

44
0:02:02,640 --> 0:02:05,680
When are my friends gonna feed me?

45
0:02:05,680 --> 0:02:07,680
I am hungry.

46
0:02:07,680 --> 0:02:09,360
I am hungry.

47
0:02:09,360 --> 0:02:10,960
Now because the room is soundproof,

48
0:02:10,960 --> 0:02:14,960
even though the food arrived, I didn't realize it until I checked two hours later.

49
0:02:14,960 --> 0:02:16,080
Too hungry to walk.

50
0:02:16,080 --> 0:02:18,240
That's a little dramatic, man. Come on.

51
0:02:18,240 --> 0:02:22,160
So when I finally checked, oh, I was not actually expecting food.

52
0:02:22,160 --> 0:02:23,280
This tastes awesome.

53
0:02:23,280 --> 0:02:26,400
I mean, it's cold and soggy, and I'm just so deprived of feeling things.

54
0:02:26,400 --> 0:02:27,600
This is great.

55
0:02:28,400 --> 0:02:32,800
This solitary confinement set is literally wrapped in metal chains.

56
0:02:32,800 --> 0:02:36,560
If this set caught on fire, I would probably burn alive before they can unlock it.

57
0:02:37,440 --> 0:02:39,360
Anyways, I'm gonna think about other things than that.

58
0:02:40,160 --> 0:02:43,840
For the next few hours, I tried to keep myself as stimulated as humanly possible.

59
0:02:44,960 --> 0:02:46,320
Oh, that's kind of cool.

60
0:02:46,320 --> 0:02:48,560
He's got nothing he has nothing to work with.

61
0:02:48,640 --> 0:02:51,440
If he's already resulting to this for basic stimulation,

62
0:02:51,440 --> 0:02:53,520
I have my doubts that he'll last seven days.

63
0:02:53,520 --> 0:02:55,920
It's interesting how when you take everything away from a man,

64
0:02:55,920 --> 0:02:59,280
something as simple as a metal plate can be like as fun as an iPhone.

65
0:03:00,240 --> 0:03:03,280
He's gonna get agitated by way of boredom.

66
0:03:03,280 --> 0:03:05,920
This is a very dehumanizing experience.

67
0:03:05,920 --> 0:03:08,000
I'm just gonna go to bed and we'll see what happens.

68
0:03:12,560 --> 0:03:15,120
I think I'm around 40 hours into the challenge.

69
0:03:15,120 --> 0:03:17,680
Jimmy's six hours off on what time he thinks it is.

70
0:03:17,680 --> 0:03:20,320
Which means it's around 4 p.m. on day number two.

71
0:03:20,320 --> 0:03:21,920
I thought he'd be on track today.

72
0:03:21,920 --> 0:03:24,000
Losing my sense of time led to other problems.

73
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,640
No matter what I do, I literally just can't sleep.

74
0:03:28,880 --> 0:03:31,600
These lights are just really messing with my brain.

75
0:03:34,080 --> 0:03:36,560
Maybe I just lay here for the next five days.

76
0:03:36,560 --> 0:03:39,280
The reason he has insomnia is he doesn't need to sleep.

77
0:03:39,280 --> 0:03:42,160
He wants to sleep this off and just get it over with,

78
0:03:42,160 --> 0:03:45,200
but what he should be doing is trying to do something that

79
0:03:45,200 --> 0:03:47,200
is gonna occupy his attention while he's awake.

80
0:03:47,280 --> 0:03:48,400
He's climbing the wall.

81
0:03:48,400 --> 0:03:50,480
It's the natural human urge for freedom.

82
0:03:50,480 --> 0:03:52,240
He's regressing to primal instinct.

83
0:03:52,240 --> 0:03:53,600
Why did I think it was 4 p.m.?

84
0:03:55,120 --> 0:03:57,440
Shouldn't that mean it's 9 p.m.?

85
0:03:57,440 --> 0:03:59,920
And by the time I had gone around eating my first meal,

86
0:03:59,920 --> 0:04:01,680
it was 4 30 in the afternoon.

87
0:04:01,680 --> 0:04:03,520
Don't get me wrong, the food looks good,

88
0:04:03,520 --> 0:04:04,880
but it is freezing cold.

89
0:04:06,640 --> 0:04:08,560
I'd rather starve than eat the rest of this.

90
0:04:11,680 --> 0:04:12,960
When my second meal had arrived,

91
0:04:12,960 --> 0:04:14,960
it felt like only minutes had passed.

92
0:04:14,960 --> 0:04:16,400
What just came through the conveyor belt?

93
0:04:17,200 --> 0:04:18,560
Wait, how long has it been?

94
0:04:18,560 --> 0:04:20,640
Am I supposed to eat both or...?

95
0:04:20,640 --> 0:04:23,440
It definitely was day two when I got the second breakfast,

96
0:04:23,440 --> 0:04:24,720
but I didn't eat much of the breakfast,

97
0:04:24,720 --> 0:04:27,280
so maybe they felt bad because I didn't eat much of the breakfast.

98
0:04:27,280 --> 0:04:27,840
Well, no.

99
0:04:27,840 --> 0:04:30,480
At this point, I had no idea how long that first meal

100
0:04:30,480 --> 0:04:32,080
was sitting in the conveyor belt for.

101
0:04:32,080 --> 0:04:34,000
You see he's getting a little paranoid?

102
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:36,400
That's the thing that can get worse as time goes on.

103
0:04:36,400 --> 0:04:37,280
It's only day two.

104
0:04:37,920 --> 0:04:39,440
I'm not sure what to do.

105
0:04:39,440 --> 0:04:41,440
I think I'm gonna just see how high I can count.

106
0:04:41,440 --> 0:04:45,360
One, two, three, four, five, six, five, six,

107
0:04:45,360 --> 0:04:46,880
five, six, six, five, six, seven,

108
0:04:46,880 --> 0:04:50,000
but when you're in a situation where there's nothing to do,

109
0:04:50,000 --> 0:04:51,520
and 199,

110
0:04:51,520 --> 0:04:53,840
what's crazy is to just succumb to it.

111
0:04:53,840 --> 0:04:55,440
1000.

112
0:04:55,440 --> 0:04:56,560
As this progresses,

113
0:04:56,560 --> 0:04:58,560
he's gonna run out of random things to do.

114
0:04:58,560 --> 0:04:59,520
And I gotta give it to him.

115
0:04:59,520 --> 0:05:00,880
The doctor was right,

116
0:05:00,880 --> 0:05:02,160
because later in this challenge,

117
0:05:02,160 --> 0:05:03,600
I borderline go insane.

118
0:05:04,400 --> 0:05:05,600
Do you think I'd get a...

119
0:05:05,600 --> 0:05:06,320
Do you think I'd...

120
0:05:16,880 --> 0:05:28,000
And while my strategy to sleep through most of the challenge

121
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:29,280
did help pass the time,

122
0:05:29,280 --> 0:05:30,960
it ended up hurting me in other ways.

123
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:37,600
I see food over there.

124
0:05:37,600 --> 0:05:40,080
It's freaking soggy and cold.

125
0:05:40,080 --> 0:05:41,680
How long has this been sitting here?

126
0:05:41,680 --> 0:05:43,520
This food's been sitting there for seven hours.

127
0:05:44,560 --> 0:05:46,160
I would have given anything

128
0:05:46,160 --> 0:05:47,040
to eat that ice cream.

129
0:05:47,760 --> 0:05:50,400
It would have been nice to have edible parts of the meal.

130
0:05:50,400 --> 0:05:52,640
Well, I guess I'll just be hungry again.

131
0:05:52,640 --> 0:05:55,840
Normally, because we're working on so many videos at once,

132
0:05:55,840 --> 0:05:58,000
I'm usually like incredibly stressed.

133
0:05:58,000 --> 0:05:58,720
As of right now,

134
0:05:59,280 --> 0:06:00,880
I don't really feel that stressed at all,

135
0:06:00,880 --> 0:06:02,880
but I feel a ton of anxiety

136
0:06:02,880 --> 0:06:05,040
because I have this severe FOMO

137
0:06:05,040 --> 0:06:06,640
that I'm missing tons of cool stuff

138
0:06:06,640 --> 0:06:07,600
going on in the world.

139
0:06:07,600 --> 0:06:08,320
It's weird.

140
0:06:08,320 --> 0:06:11,360
It's a different emotion that I'm used to.

141
0:06:11,360 --> 0:06:15,600
It's pretty crazy how hard it is to do nothing.

142
0:06:16,240 --> 0:06:18,480
I'm starting to get really bored.

143
0:06:18,480 --> 0:06:20,640
Oh, this is getting very hard on me mentally.

144
0:06:20,640 --> 0:06:21,600
I'm bored.

145
0:06:22,320 --> 0:06:23,120
Help.

146
0:06:23,120 --> 0:06:26,320
I was nowhere near the 168-hour mark,

147
0:06:26,320 --> 0:06:28,720
so by hour 65, I started to wonder,

148
0:06:28,720 --> 0:06:29,840
how do you do a handstand?

149
0:06:36,640 --> 0:06:37,040
Ow.

150
0:06:37,920 --> 0:06:39,200
Wish before I came in here,

151
0:06:39,200 --> 0:06:40,960
I had someone teach me the basics

152
0:06:40,960 --> 0:06:42,640
of how to do a handstand.

153
0:06:43,680 --> 0:06:45,440
He's going to have to invent concepts

154
0:06:45,440 --> 0:06:47,120
that only exist in his mind

155
0:06:47,120 --> 0:06:50,080
to keep himself from experiencing intense depression.

156
0:06:50,080 --> 0:06:50,960
I'm just going to envision

157
0:06:50,960 --> 0:06:52,560
that I'm currently walking in a park.

158
0:06:53,360 --> 0:06:54,480
There's a green grass.

159
0:06:55,360 --> 0:06:56,160
Someone's fishing.

160
0:06:56,800 --> 0:06:58,560
He's literally making up scenarios

161
0:06:58,560 --> 0:06:59,360
in his head right now.

162
0:06:59,360 --> 0:07:00,000
Oh, my God.

163
0:07:00,000 --> 0:07:01,200
All in all, it's very sunny.

164
0:07:01,840 --> 0:07:02,720
I hear birds.

165
0:07:04,560 --> 0:07:06,080
You ruined my walk in the park.

166
0:07:06,080 --> 0:07:07,520
Oh, my God.

167
0:07:07,520 --> 0:07:09,280
We're watching him slip into madness.

168
0:07:11,440 --> 0:07:12,080
Ooh.

169
0:07:12,080 --> 0:07:13,360
They gave me more food,

170
0:07:13,360 --> 0:07:15,280
but it looks like we got some rice,

171
0:07:15,280 --> 0:07:17,040
sweet potato, and steak.

172
0:07:17,040 --> 0:07:18,560
This is the best meal I've gotten

173
0:07:18,560 --> 0:07:19,840
so far at this challenge.

174
0:07:19,840 --> 0:07:21,040
If you look right here,

175
0:07:21,040 --> 0:07:22,240
you'll see some rice.

176
0:07:22,240 --> 0:07:23,600
And any ordinary human

177
0:07:23,600 --> 0:07:24,880
would probably eat this rice.

178
0:07:25,520 --> 0:07:26,640
But I'm going to count it.

179
0:07:26,640 --> 0:07:28,720
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,

180
0:07:28,720 --> 0:07:30,640
17, 19, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11,

181
0:07:30,640 --> 0:07:32,160
11, 12, 15, 12, 16,

182
0:07:32,160 --> 0:07:33,360
6, 12, 15, 16, 17,

183
0:07:33,360 --> 0:07:34,880
17, 18, 19, 19, 20,

184
0:07:34,880 --> 0:07:36,080
20, 20, 21, 21,

185
0:07:36,080 --> 0:07:37,920
22, 22, 23, 24, 25,

186
0:07:37,920 --> 0:07:41,600
446, 447.

187
0:07:41,600 --> 0:07:44,480
There are 447 grains of rice

188
0:07:44,480 --> 0:07:45,440
on this metal tray.

189
0:07:45,440 --> 0:07:46,640
This information probably

190
0:07:46,640 --> 0:07:48,480
profoundly changed you as a human.

191
0:07:50,400 --> 0:07:52,160
I'm feeling pretty tired,

192
0:07:52,160 --> 0:07:53,280
which means it's probably

193
0:07:53,280 --> 0:07:54,320
the night of the fifth.

194
0:07:55,040 --> 0:07:56,480
I wasn't even halfway through

195
0:07:56,480 --> 0:07:57,040
the challenge.

196
0:07:57,040 --> 0:07:59,440
It was already off a full day.

197
0:07:59,440 --> 0:08:00,320
I'm going to get some more

198
0:08:00,320 --> 0:08:01,600
disease in the bathroom

199
0:08:01,600 --> 0:08:03,360
where it's not so freaking bright.

200
0:08:03,920 --> 0:08:04,880
Which proved to be my

201
0:08:04,880 --> 0:08:05,840
smartest move yet

202
0:08:05,840 --> 0:08:06,960
because I actually slept

203
0:08:06,960 --> 0:08:09,120
in that bathroom for 12 hours.

204
0:08:09,120 --> 0:08:10,800
We're officially halfway

205
0:08:10,800 --> 0:08:11,680
into the challenge.

206
0:08:11,680 --> 0:08:12,560
84 hours.

207
0:08:12,560 --> 0:08:13,040
Jimmy is.

208
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:14,800
And we're going to tell him

209
0:08:14,800 --> 0:08:15,840
that in his next meal.

210
0:08:15,840 --> 0:08:17,520
Just to kind of mix it all up for him.

211
0:08:17,520 --> 0:08:18,080
I mean, you can still

212
0:08:18,080 --> 0:08:18,960
put the letters together.

213
0:08:20,080 --> 0:08:21,440
I am hungy.

214
0:08:21,440 --> 0:08:22,640
Hungy, I am.

215
0:08:22,640 --> 0:08:23,760
What are we working with here?

216
0:08:24,320 --> 0:08:25,280
What is this?

217
0:08:25,280 --> 0:08:26,560
Bros never heard of SpaghettiOs?

218
0:08:26,560 --> 0:08:27,920
And that wasn't the only thing

219
0:08:27,920 --> 0:08:28,960
I was forgetting the name of.

220
0:08:28,960 --> 0:08:29,760
What is this called?

221
0:08:30,640 --> 0:08:31,200
This is a...

222
0:08:34,080 --> 0:08:34,960
A roll.

223
0:08:34,960 --> 0:08:36,160
This is a lot of sauce

224
0:08:36,160 --> 0:08:37,120
for one roll.

225
0:08:37,120 --> 0:08:38,560
Can I taste like ketchup?

226
0:08:38,560 --> 0:08:39,280
How does he not notice

227
0:08:39,280 --> 0:08:40,240
the letters in there?

228
0:08:40,240 --> 0:08:41,760
Oh, that's an N.

229
0:08:43,360 --> 0:08:44,400
You guys forgot to take

230
0:08:44,400 --> 0:08:45,760
these four SpaghettiOs out.

231
0:08:45,760 --> 0:08:46,320
No.

232
0:08:46,320 --> 0:08:47,200
Every time he finds a letter

233
0:08:47,200 --> 0:08:48,080
he just keeps eating it.

234
0:08:50,960 --> 0:08:51,760
I hope those weren't

235
0:08:51,760 --> 0:08:53,120
supposed to spell something.

236
0:08:53,120 --> 0:08:54,160
They were symmetrically

237
0:08:54,160 --> 0:08:55,200
supposed to realize

238
0:08:55,200 --> 0:08:56,480
that before I ate them

239
0:08:56,480 --> 0:08:57,440
and then put it together

240
0:08:57,440 --> 0:08:58,320
to figure out a word

241
0:08:58,320 --> 0:08:58,960
for more food.

242
0:09:00,640 --> 0:09:01,440
Surely that's not

243
0:09:01,440 --> 0:09:02,320
what they wanted from you.

244
0:09:02,320 --> 0:09:03,360
Jimmy's about to watch

245
0:09:03,360 --> 0:09:04,160
this when he gets out

246
0:09:04,160 --> 0:09:05,520
and feels so dumb.

247
0:09:06,400 --> 0:09:07,200
Depression.

248
0:09:07,200 --> 0:09:07,920
At this point,

249
0:09:07,920 --> 0:09:08,640
the bright lights

250
0:09:08,640 --> 0:09:09,840
were starting to get to me.

251
0:09:09,840 --> 0:09:12,160
I have a ginormous

252
0:09:12,160 --> 0:09:13,360
headache right now

253
0:09:13,360 --> 0:09:14,720
and I'm so

254
0:09:14,720 --> 0:09:15,520
hungry.

255
0:09:15,520 --> 0:09:17,120
What is going on to my body?

256
0:09:17,120 --> 0:09:18,560
Well, he did ask for more food

257
0:09:18,560 --> 0:09:19,280
even though he is

258
0:09:19,280 --> 0:09:20,720
getting all the calories he needs.

259
0:09:20,720 --> 0:09:21,680
But the reason for that

260
0:09:21,680 --> 0:09:22,960
is that he's so under stimulated

261
0:09:22,960 --> 0:09:24,080
he thinks he's starving.

262
0:09:24,080 --> 0:09:25,520
I ended up checking for food

263
0:09:25,520 --> 0:09:27,120
over and over

264
0:09:27,120 --> 0:09:28,000
and over again.

265
0:09:28,640 --> 0:09:29,760
This is oddly soothing.

266
0:09:30,400 --> 0:09:31,200
Do you think I'd get

267
0:09:31,200 --> 0:09:33,360
a concussion from doing this?

268
0:09:33,360 --> 0:09:34,560
You should probably stop.

269
0:09:34,560 --> 0:09:35,200
You're right.

270
0:09:35,200 --> 0:09:36,160
I should probably stop.

271
0:09:39,040 --> 0:09:41,120
There's a bag of McDonald's here.

272
0:09:41,120 --> 0:09:42,960
It's suspiciously light.

273
0:09:42,960 --> 0:09:44,160
If there is not McDonald's

274
0:09:44,160 --> 0:09:44,880
in this bag,

275
0:09:44,880 --> 0:09:46,000
I'm going to be depressed.

276
0:09:47,200 --> 0:09:48,400
There actually is.

277
0:09:48,400 --> 0:09:49,680
Let's go.

278
0:09:49,680 --> 0:09:50,960
Every time I get a meal,

279
0:09:50,960 --> 0:09:52,480
it's like 20 minutes

280
0:09:52,480 --> 0:09:54,000
of just pure happiness.

281
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:55,520
I feel human again.

282
0:09:55,520 --> 0:09:56,720
I can't stop smiling.

283
0:09:57,440 --> 0:09:58,480
I'm so happy.

284
0:09:58,480 --> 0:10:00,400
And then the second I finish it,

285
0:10:00,400 --> 0:10:01,920
I feel a wave of depression

286
0:10:01,920 --> 0:10:02,480
because I'm like,

287
0:10:02,480 --> 0:10:03,280
what do I do now?

288
0:10:04,960 --> 0:10:06,000
The seconds are starting

289
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:07,920
to blend together so much.

290
0:10:07,920 --> 0:10:08,720
I would try to guess

291
0:10:08,720 --> 0:10:09,760
what time it is,

292
0:10:09,760 --> 0:10:11,440
but I have no earthly idea.

293
0:10:11,440 --> 0:10:14,080
My mind is slowly deforming

294
0:10:14,080 --> 0:10:15,120
into stupidity.

295
0:10:15,120 --> 0:10:16,960
I need to occupy myself better.

296
0:10:16,960 --> 0:10:17,600
We're going to grab

297
0:10:17,600 --> 0:10:19,600
this McDonald's cheeseburger wrapper

298
0:10:19,600 --> 0:10:20,640
as well as this cup

299
0:10:20,640 --> 0:10:22,240
that was holding my toothbrush.

300
0:10:22,240 --> 0:10:23,040
And now,

301
0:10:23,040 --> 0:10:24,320
we have basketball,

302
0:10:24,320 --> 0:10:24,800
LeBron,

303
0:10:25,440 --> 0:10:26,320
Steph,

304
0:10:26,320 --> 0:10:26,800
Kobe.

305
0:10:27,760 --> 0:10:29,200
Maybe basketball is not my thing.

306
0:10:29,200 --> 0:10:30,560
I think I was always better at baseball.

307
0:10:31,200 --> 0:10:32,000
Stay right.

308
0:10:33,840 --> 0:10:35,600
That was not what was supposed to happen.

309
0:10:35,600 --> 0:10:36,560
And then I remembered

310
0:10:36,560 --> 0:10:37,440
what could I have done.

311
0:10:37,440 --> 0:10:38,560
Oh, there's a fork on it.

312
0:10:38,560 --> 0:10:40,320
That I had an indestructible plate

313
0:10:40,320 --> 0:10:41,680
from my very first meal.

314
0:10:42,320 --> 0:10:43,840
I am going to throw this

315
0:10:43,840 --> 0:10:44,800
so far.

316
0:10:44,800 --> 0:10:45,760
It is hilarious.

317
0:10:51,040 --> 0:10:52,240
I'm bored.

318
0:10:52,240 --> 0:10:53,680
I still have two days left

319
0:10:53,680 --> 0:10:54,640
inside this room

320
0:10:54,640 --> 0:10:55,440
and I have a feeling

321
0:10:55,440 --> 0:10:56,400
at some point

322
0:10:56,400 --> 0:10:57,520
I'm going to want to leave.

323
0:10:57,520 --> 0:10:58,800
It's day four.

324
0:10:58,800 --> 0:10:59,920
How much I bang

325
0:10:59,920 --> 0:11:00,880
or scream

326
0:11:00,880 --> 0:11:01,520
or plead

327
0:11:02,560 --> 0:11:03,360
or burp.

328
0:11:03,360 --> 0:11:05,120
Do not let me out of this room early.

329
0:11:05,120 --> 0:11:06,160
Okay, Jimmy, I got you.

330
0:11:06,160 --> 0:11:07,120
My instincts tell me

331
0:11:07,200 --> 0:11:10,000
I've so far done 113 hours,

332
0:11:10,000 --> 0:11:12,080
which means I have 55 hours remaining.

333
0:11:12,080 --> 0:11:13,360
And whoever's editing this

334
0:11:13,360 --> 0:11:14,240
show them how many hours

335
0:11:14,240 --> 0:11:15,440
I actually have remaining.

336
0:11:15,440 --> 0:11:18,240
Hopefully it's somewhere close to 55 hours.

337
0:11:18,240 --> 0:11:20,080
I think he's going to get angry

338
0:11:20,080 --> 0:11:21,520
and possibly paranoid

339
0:11:21,520 --> 0:11:22,640
about what's going on.

340
0:11:22,640 --> 0:11:24,320
Is a man not allowed

341
0:11:24,320 --> 0:11:25,600
to have privacy?

342
0:11:25,600 --> 0:11:26,560
There's a camera there.

343
0:11:26,560 --> 0:11:27,600
There's a camera above that.

344
0:11:27,600 --> 0:11:29,280
There's a camera, camera, camera,

345
0:11:29,280 --> 0:11:31,120
camera, camera, camera, camera.

346
0:11:31,120 --> 0:11:32,560
There's so many cameras

347
0:11:32,560 --> 0:11:34,320
on me 24 seven.

348
0:11:34,320 --> 0:11:35,440
I'm going to go insane.

349
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:37,760
What if we throw the camera

350
0:11:37,760 --> 0:11:38,720
through the commitment?

351
0:11:38,720 --> 0:11:39,440
Genius.

352
0:11:39,440 --> 0:11:40,480
I'm going to treat it like bowling.

353
0:11:44,720 --> 0:11:46,400
Somehow I hit my finger.

354
0:11:46,400 --> 0:11:46,720
Ow.

355
0:11:51,200 --> 0:11:53,120
I severely underestimated

356
0:11:53,120 --> 0:11:54,640
how hard this video would be.

357
0:11:54,640 --> 0:11:55,520
Just thinking about it

358
0:11:55,520 --> 0:11:56,960
has me like tearing up.

359
0:11:56,960 --> 0:11:58,960
But I kind of feel like an animal

360
0:11:58,960 --> 0:11:59,360
right now.

361
0:11:59,360 --> 0:12:01,200
Like I feel like I lost all my rights

362
0:12:01,200 --> 0:12:02,160
as a human.

363
0:12:02,160 --> 0:12:03,120
If I had to guess,

364
0:12:03,120 --> 0:12:05,120
I would say I'm halfway through day five.

365
0:12:05,520 --> 0:12:07,200
I really miss my girlfriend

366
0:12:07,200 --> 0:12:08,880
and I miss the gang as well.

367
0:12:09,600 --> 0:12:10,320
Even Nolan.

368
0:12:11,440 --> 0:12:12,160
Even Nolan.

369
0:12:13,280 --> 0:12:14,800
Mentally right now I'd say

370
0:12:14,800 --> 0:12:16,960
I'm at like literal rock bottom.

371
0:12:16,960 --> 0:12:18,960
Like this is very inhumane.

372
0:12:18,960 --> 0:12:20,080
I've been in here so long

373
0:12:20,080 --> 0:12:21,440
that some of my dreams

374
0:12:21,440 --> 0:12:22,880
are about me in this room.

375
0:12:22,880 --> 0:12:24,720
And I think it's like day six or seven.

376
0:12:24,720 --> 0:12:25,920
But then I wake up

377
0:12:25,920 --> 0:12:27,200
and realize it was a dream.

378
0:12:28,960 --> 0:12:30,000
What time is it?

379
0:12:30,000 --> 0:12:31,840
I would pay so much money

380
0:12:31,840 --> 0:12:34,160
to know what freaking time it is.

381
0:12:34,160 --> 0:12:35,280
Let's go over why I think

382
0:12:35,280 --> 0:12:37,360
there are 33 hours left in this challenge.

383
0:12:39,360 --> 0:12:40,640
I've slept five times.

384
0:12:41,840 --> 0:12:42,880
Reason number two,

385
0:12:42,880 --> 0:12:44,400
I usually poop once a day

386
0:12:44,400 --> 0:12:46,240
and I've also pooped five times

387
0:12:46,240 --> 0:12:46,880
since I got in here.

388
0:12:48,240 --> 0:12:49,280
Reason number three,

389
0:12:49,280 --> 0:12:51,280
I've grown a lot of hair on my neck here

390
0:12:51,280 --> 0:12:53,120
and this usually does take like a week.

391
0:12:53,120 --> 0:12:54,160
If for some reason it's...

392
0:12:57,040 --> 0:12:59,040
If for some reason it's still day five

393
0:12:59,040 --> 0:13:01,920
or God forbid it's somehow still day four,

394
0:13:01,920 --> 0:13:03,680
I will lose my mind.

395
0:13:05,280 --> 0:13:06,320
While I was sleeping,

396
0:13:06,320 --> 0:13:07,840
I had a dream about the one time

397
0:13:07,840 --> 0:13:09,440
that I counted to 100,000

398
0:13:09,440 --> 0:13:10,400
and so when I woke up,

399
0:13:10,400 --> 0:13:12,880
I decided to do a thousand laps around this room.

400
0:13:13,440 --> 0:13:14,880
You know, for old time's sake.

401
0:13:15,520 --> 0:13:16,720
I'll be the marker.

402
0:13:16,720 --> 0:13:17,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

403
0:13:17,280 --> 0:13:18,400
Watching back this footage,

404
0:13:18,400 --> 0:13:19,680
it's literally crazy.

405
0:13:19,680 --> 0:13:21,680
I resorted to walking in circles

406
0:13:21,680 --> 0:13:22,960
to keep myself sane.

407
0:13:22,960 --> 0:13:24,400
A thousand is way too many.

408
0:13:24,400 --> 0:13:25,760
I'm already starting to get dizzy.

409
0:13:25,760 --> 0:13:27,040
This entire challenge,

410
0:13:27,040 --> 0:13:29,120
I've been getting water out of this sink.

411
0:13:29,120 --> 0:13:30,320
And I'm gonna be honest,

412
0:13:30,320 --> 0:13:31,520
is this in...

413
0:13:32,480 --> 0:13:33,120
It...

414
0:13:33,840 --> 0:13:34,640
I'm not...

415
0:13:34,720 --> 0:13:35,280
Bro.

416
0:13:35,280 --> 0:13:36,800
Circle is a flavor cartridge

417
0:13:36,800 --> 0:13:38,240
you can screw on your water bottle

418
0:13:38,240 --> 0:13:40,640
and makes bland water taste amazing.

419
0:13:40,640 --> 0:13:42,400
There's over a hundred different flavors

420
0:13:42,400 --> 0:13:43,360
that fit this bottle

421
0:13:43,360 --> 0:13:45,600
that are all zero calories and zero sugar.

422
0:13:47,200 --> 0:13:48,880
Moving this tripod is miserable.

423
0:13:49,840 --> 0:13:51,920
Choose how intense you want the flavor

424
0:13:53,200 --> 0:13:54,560
and then start drinking away.

425
0:13:54,560 --> 0:13:56,000
It honestly adds so much flavor

426
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:57,520
I can't even tell it's sink water.

427
0:13:57,520 --> 0:13:58,640
I've been drinking fruit punch

428
0:13:58,640 --> 0:14:00,240
throughout this entire challenge

429
0:14:00,240 --> 0:14:02,800
and it actually makes the water taste amazing.

430
0:14:03,360 --> 0:14:05,520
I'm gonna walk back and forth between these walls.

431
0:14:05,520 --> 0:14:08,080
These cartridges also last for multiple refills

432
0:14:08,080 --> 0:14:09,040
of your water bottle,

433
0:14:09,040 --> 0:14:11,440
which is good because the boys suck at sending these

434
0:14:11,440 --> 0:14:14,000
and sometimes I gotta use the same one for a whole day.

435
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:15,680
If you want to start drinking more water

436
0:14:15,680 --> 0:14:18,480
or just want your water to start tasting good in general,

437
0:14:18,480 --> 0:14:19,840
go to drinkscircle.com

438
0:14:19,840 --> 0:14:21,680
or your local Walmart to give it a try.

439
0:14:21,680 --> 0:14:22,880
I've tried everything.

440
0:14:22,880 --> 0:14:24,320
Be keep myself entertained

441
0:14:24,320 --> 0:14:25,200
and I'm gonna be honest,

442
0:14:26,400 --> 0:14:27,360
it's not working.

443
0:14:28,400 --> 0:14:29,920
And after I finished all my circles,

444
0:14:29,920 --> 0:14:31,200
Carl brought back two people

445
0:14:31,200 --> 0:14:32,720
from 100 Days Trap together.

446
0:14:32,720 --> 0:14:33,280
We're here.

447
0:14:33,280 --> 0:14:34,960
Check it out, you guys are gonna love this.

448
0:14:34,960 --> 0:14:37,520
That's the face of the guy that trapped you guys for 100 days.

449
0:14:38,960 --> 0:14:40,960
Would you say this is easier or harder than what you guys did?

450
0:14:40,960 --> 0:14:46,080
In comparison, I think I'd rather have someone else in it with me.

451
0:14:46,080 --> 0:14:47,760
And now that the tables had turned

452
0:14:47,760 --> 0:14:49,920
and I was the one inside the white cube,

453
0:14:49,920 --> 0:14:51,520
Bailey and Susie got the revenge.

454
0:14:51,520 --> 0:14:53,040
So I'll show you guys how the conveyor belt works.

455
0:14:54,400 --> 0:14:55,440
They sent an empty tray.

456
0:14:55,440 --> 0:14:57,280
He's about to freak out.

457
0:14:57,280 --> 0:14:58,240
I don't feel bad at all.

458
0:14:58,240 --> 0:14:59,280
This is what he gets.

459
0:14:59,280 --> 0:15:01,120
I bet every dollar in my bank account

460
0:15:01,200 --> 0:15:02,240
Carl just showed up.

461
0:15:02,240 --> 0:15:03,120
No, what?

462
0:15:03,920 --> 0:15:05,040
You hungry, Jimmy?

463
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:06,640
Eat this.

464
0:15:07,280 --> 0:15:08,240
No, we're not doing this again.

465
0:15:08,240 --> 0:15:09,520
We are not doing this.

466
0:15:09,520 --> 0:15:10,400
We're not doing this.

467
0:15:10,400 --> 0:15:12,240
This is the most stimulation he's had in days.

468
0:15:24,320 --> 0:15:25,760
Well, you gotta give him credit.

469
0:15:25,760 --> 0:15:27,120
I probably deserve that.

470
0:15:27,920 --> 0:15:32,240
Imagine this is what happens after you die.

471
0:15:33,920 --> 0:15:35,840
You just go to a white room like this forever.

472
0:15:36,960 --> 0:15:38,080
That would be miserable.

473
0:15:40,000 --> 0:15:42,960
When I sleep, I dream of me in the outside world.

474
0:15:42,960 --> 0:15:47,120
And when I'm awake, I'm just depressed, lonely,

475
0:15:47,840 --> 0:15:49,200
and to be honest, miserable.

476
0:15:50,640 --> 0:15:54,000
So the more time I spend sleeping, the happier I am.

477
0:15:55,200 --> 0:15:55,840
Let me out.

478
0:15:57,840 --> 0:15:58,480
I'm Batman.

479
0:16:01,040 --> 0:16:01,840
I feel dead.

480
0:16:02,480 --> 0:16:04,720
I really need to get out of here.

481
0:16:04,720 --> 0:16:06,480
We did seven days on a raft.

482
0:16:06,480 --> 0:16:08,320
I did seven days buried alive

483
0:16:08,320 --> 0:16:11,120
and now seven days in solitary confinement.

484
0:16:11,120 --> 0:16:12,800
If I had known how hard this would be,

485
0:16:13,360 --> 0:16:14,880
I never would have done this.

486
0:16:14,880 --> 0:16:16,640
If that hour number in the top left

487
0:16:17,200 --> 0:16:19,280
says anything higher than 20,

488
0:16:19,280 --> 0:16:20,720
I'm going to lose my mind.

489
0:16:20,720 --> 0:16:22,320
I am feeling extremely lonely.

490
0:16:22,880 --> 0:16:24,160
I miss my girlfriend.

491
0:16:25,120 --> 0:16:26,480
This is torture.

492
0:16:26,560 --> 0:16:27,520
Is he crying?

493
0:16:27,520 --> 0:16:29,040
He's not doing well.

494
0:16:29,040 --> 0:16:30,880
He's just like napping on the floor,

495
0:16:30,880 --> 0:16:33,040
throwing things, having tantrums,

496
0:16:33,040 --> 0:16:34,480
getting happy when he gets snacks.

497
0:16:34,480 --> 0:16:35,440
He's like a child.

498
0:16:35,440 --> 0:16:37,440
I think there's eight hours left

499
0:16:37,440 --> 0:16:40,000
and then they're going to open that door right there

500
0:16:40,000 --> 0:16:41,040
and I am free.

501
0:16:42,080 --> 0:16:43,200
I hope I pray.

502
0:16:43,200 --> 0:16:44,400
Please be eight hours.

503
0:16:44,400 --> 0:16:45,920
He thinks he's sleeping through

504
0:16:45,920 --> 0:16:47,280
the last couple hours right now.

505
0:16:47,280 --> 0:16:48,240
That's what he thinks this is.

506
0:16:48,240 --> 0:16:49,840
So it's going to be a rude awakening,

507
0:16:49,840 --> 0:16:50,480
literally.

508
0:16:50,480 --> 0:16:51,760
To be honest, it's concerning.

509
0:16:53,440 --> 0:16:55,600
I give it maybe another two to three hours

510
0:16:55,600 --> 0:16:56,560
and that door opens.

511
0:16:56,560 --> 0:16:57,840
So I'm going to enjoy my last meal

512
0:16:57,840 --> 0:16:58,880
and then we're getting out of here.

513
0:16:58,880 --> 0:17:00,160
Did he just say it's his last meal?

514
0:17:00,160 --> 0:17:00,960
I think so.

515
0:17:00,960 --> 0:17:01,840
Well, that's ironic

516
0:17:01,840 --> 0:17:04,560
because it's literally exactly 24 hours.

517
0:17:04,560 --> 0:17:05,520
Any hour now,

518
0:17:05,520 --> 0:17:07,120
they're going to be walking through that door.

519
0:17:07,120 --> 0:17:08,560
So I'm going to clean up the place.

520
0:17:08,560 --> 0:17:10,240
It's a little messy, you know.

521
0:17:10,240 --> 0:17:12,160
I was trying to make up an excuse to clean,

522
0:17:12,160 --> 0:17:13,920
but in reality, I'm just bored.

523
0:17:14,960 --> 0:17:16,640
I thought coming into this experiment,

524
0:17:16,640 --> 0:17:18,640
I would get more mental clarity,

525
0:17:18,640 --> 0:17:20,480
maybe learn a little bit about myself,

526
0:17:20,480 --> 0:17:22,800
but in reality, all I'm walking away with

527
0:17:22,800 --> 0:17:24,640
is the newfound skill of being able

528
0:17:24,720 --> 0:17:26,640
to throw things out a conveyor belt door,

529
0:17:27,680 --> 0:17:28,880
or maybe not.

530
0:17:28,880 --> 0:17:30,560
There is just no world

531
0:17:30,560 --> 0:17:32,400
where there's more than 24 hours left.

532
0:17:32,400 --> 0:17:35,120
I can't do another 24 hours in here.

533
0:17:35,120 --> 0:17:36,720
I'm at my limit,

534
0:17:36,720 --> 0:17:37,600
but it doesn't even matter.

535
0:17:37,600 --> 0:17:39,360
There is just not 24 hours left.

536
0:17:39,360 --> 0:17:40,400
I just don't,

537
0:17:40,400 --> 0:17:42,240
I refuse to believe that.

538
0:17:42,240 --> 0:17:43,760
So any second now,

539
0:17:47,520 --> 0:17:48,560
the past the time,

540
0:17:48,560 --> 0:17:50,080
I'm going to resume counting.

541
0:17:50,080 --> 0:17:54,400
One, two, three, four, five, six,

542
0:17:54,880 --> 0:18:06,640
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,

543
0:18:06,640 --> 0:18:13,840
5,222, 5,423, 5,424, 5,425.

544
0:18:20,320 --> 0:18:22,400
I swear to God, I heard something out there.

545
0:18:24,960 --> 0:18:32,640
I'm sad.

546
0:18:32,640 --> 0:18:34,640
I'm sad.

547
0:18:34,640 --> 0:18:36,640
I am sad.

548
0:18:36,640 --> 0:18:40,640
I am sad.

549
0:18:40,640 --> 0:18:42,640
I don't want to be here.

550
0:18:42,640 --> 0:18:46,640
Get me out of this room.

551
0:18:46,640 --> 0:18:48,640
I don't want to be here.

552
0:18:48,640 --> 0:18:50,640
I don't want to be here.

553
0:18:50,640 --> 0:18:52,640
I don't want to be here.

554
0:18:52,640 --> 0:18:54,640
This is barely human.

555
0:18:54,640 --> 0:18:56,640
He's lying in bed, covering his eyes.

556
0:18:56,640 --> 0:18:57,640
No excitement.

557
0:18:57,640 --> 0:18:59,640
This is totally not what you want to see.

558
0:18:59,640 --> 0:19:00,640
How is he going to act?

559
0:19:00,640 --> 0:19:01,640
Is he going to be a new human?

560
0:19:01,640 --> 0:19:03,640
I'm worried he's going to be this human.

561
0:19:03,640 --> 0:19:05,640
He's just collapsed into dysfunction.

562
0:19:05,640 --> 0:19:08,640
We've never pushed him as far as he has pushed in this video.

563
0:19:08,640 --> 0:19:11,640
Well, because he's been totally deprived of any human contact.

564
0:19:11,640 --> 0:19:12,640
Be gentle.

565
0:19:12,640 --> 0:19:14,640
Like a little kid waking up from a nap.

566
0:19:14,640 --> 0:19:16,640
Well, there's 10 minutes left, so let's go get ready.

567
0:19:16,640 --> 0:19:17,640
Thank you.

568
0:19:17,640 --> 0:19:18,640
Good luck.

569
0:19:19,640 --> 0:19:21,640
I'm going to die.

570
0:19:31,640 --> 0:19:32,640
Hold on.

571
0:19:32,640 --> 0:19:34,640
Wait, I don't even have pants on.

572
0:19:37,640 --> 0:19:38,640
Oh my gosh.

573
0:19:38,640 --> 0:19:39,640
Hey Jimmy.

574
0:19:39,640 --> 0:19:41,640
Sorry, I was just putting my pants on.

575
0:19:41,640 --> 0:19:42,640
It's not as bright out here.

576
0:19:42,640 --> 0:19:43,640
How is it, dude?

577
0:19:43,640 --> 0:19:44,640
I'm actually kind of lightheaded.

578
0:19:44,640 --> 0:19:46,640
You know it's crazy, but after this challenge,

579
0:19:46,640 --> 0:19:48,640
I kind of forgot how to interact with humans.

580
0:19:48,640 --> 0:19:50,640
Where are you going?

581
0:19:50,640 --> 0:19:54,640
It's actually relieving to not stare at a bright light.

582
0:19:54,640 --> 0:19:56,640
It's like the ceiling is awesome.

583
0:19:56,640 --> 0:19:59,640
The happiest I've seen you in a long time.

584
0:19:59,640 --> 0:20:03,640
Honestly, I thought it was perpetually just going to be 24 hours forever.

585
0:20:03,640 --> 0:20:04,640
Fall on the outside.

586
0:20:04,640 --> 0:20:06,640
I want to see the sun.

587
0:20:07,640 --> 0:20:08,640
Oh my God.

588
0:20:08,640 --> 0:20:09,640
Oh, it's dark out.

589
0:20:09,640 --> 0:20:13,640
So nice to see the outside world.
