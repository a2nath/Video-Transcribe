1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:04,000
This is a $250 million private island.

2
0:00:04,000 --> 0:00:08,000
Literally anything you could ever want is on this private island.

3
0:00:08,000 --> 0:00:14,000
And I'm going to show you the difference between this and a $150 million luxury island.

4
0:00:14,000 --> 0:00:17,000
A massive $45 million island.

5
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:22,000
A $5 million frozen island all the way down to the world's cheapest private island.

6
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:23,000
That thing.

7
0:00:23,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm starting to realize we might not all fit on it.

8
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
First step on my brand new island.

9
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Here's your dollar.

10
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:30,000
Thank you sir.

11
0:00:30,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Thank you for selling it to me.

12
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's yours now buddy.

13
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Let's check out what I just bought.

14
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
My first impression is a lot smaller than I thought.

15
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
When you pay a dollar you get a random pile of bricks.

16
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:40,000
An old toilet.

17
0:00:40,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I found the restroom.

18
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And a bunch of random wooden poles.

19
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There's more poles than square feet on this thing.

20
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:46,000
They're actually called pylons.

21
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Let's pile onto that boat and leave.

22
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And as you can see there's nothing here.

23
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So I'm going to blow it up.

24
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Well later in this video we're going to a $150 million island.

25
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And also a quarter billion dollar super island.

26
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But first we're going to head over to the one million dollar island called Monkey Island.

27
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Yes you heard me right.

28
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This island is literally swarmed with hundreds of monkeys.

29
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I can see why it's called Monkey Island.

30
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:12,000
What's this monkey?

31
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It's Odie.

32
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Odie took my orange.

33
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Okay.

34
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Monkey sleep with monkey take.

35
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
All the monkeys on this island have a strategy for interacting with people.

36
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
They gaslight you into thinking that you're friends.

37
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And then they steal your food.

38
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:24,000
You can have it.

39
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You can have it.

40
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:27,000
There's a monkey on the boat.

41
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:30,000
And if you're wondering where you and your friends are going to sleep on this island.

42
0:01:30,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Suspended above the water are six luxury cabanas.

43
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Which house both humans and monkeys.

44
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The monkey's grabbing the GoPro Jimmy.

45
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:40,000
Sir, we need this for filming.

46
0:01:40,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I just need to borrow this.

47
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Thank you.

48
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Okay.

49
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I got my camera back.

50
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:46,000
You want it?

51
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Oh.

52
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:48,000
He wants your hat.

53
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Okay.

54
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:50,000
You can have that sir.

55
0:01:50,000 --> 0:01:51,000
By the end of this I'm going to be naked.

56
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The monkeys are stealing everything.

57
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And the monkeys are not even the coolest part of this island.

58
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
See, this island isn't even an island at all.

59
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It's actually on top of a massive underwater plant network that emerged from the sand and

60
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:07,000
water to create this illusion of an island that we see today.

61
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Is this a million dollar island or a million dollar bush because there's no land?

62
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:12,000
What do you think?

63
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I don't know.

64
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I think an island is what you make of it.

65
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And on the other side of the island there's even a private relaxation area and a beach

66
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
front massage parlor.

67
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I'm trying not to fall in the water.

68
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I'm about to get a massage with a monkey.

69
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:26,000
That's really cool.

70
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Notice how all the water around here is freezing.

71
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:29,000
What?

72
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:30,000
That took a lot of effort.

73
0:02:30,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And we put that much effort in to convey that the five million dollar island is very

74
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
cool.

75
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And where we're going next most of the year looks like this.

76
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But it's going to look like this.

77
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:44,000
No joke this island is so cold right now that the lake around it is actually frozen

78
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:45,000
solid.

79
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Which means to get there we're going to be using an interesting vehicle.

80
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We're literally hovering.

81
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Yeah, apparently snowmobiles are just too basic for this island.

82
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It just had to be hovercrafts.

83
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This is awesome.

84
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I'm about to arrive in a fashion.

85
0:02:56,000 --> 0:03:00,000
And it only took about 30 seconds of being outside the hovercraft for the gang to be

86
0:03:00,000 --> 0:03:01,000
frozen solid.

87
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:02,000
How cold is it?

88
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's zero degrees Celsius.

89
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Pretty cold man.

90
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Even more like a 70 guy.

91
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:10,000
And so they hurried over to these futuristic self heated huts to stay warm.

92
0:03:10,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Oh this is so small.

93
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Wait, there's no room for you in here.

94
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We're going to check out a little bit.

95
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And these huts are able to stay here completely year round.

96
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Because not only can they float on warm peaceful lake water, but they also do just fine in the

97
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:23,000
dead of winter.

98
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But at least in the winter you get a great view of the northern lights.

99
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
For five million dollars you basically get a winter wonderland.

100
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And while staying on this island you're given unlimited five star food.

101
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I think he thinks we should finish.

102
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:40,000
And even though this island comes with a luxury cabin to stay in.

103
0:03:40,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Oh this is beautiful.

104
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Fine, I'll take it.

105
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Jimmy buy it for me.

106
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:50,000
They ended up spending most their time on the frozen lake where they were able to ride

107
0:03:50,000 --> 0:03:52,000
an actual dog sled.

108
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I took your glove.

109
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This is the best island.

110
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I don't know how any island is going to beat this.

111
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:00,000
Maybe one where I could feel my hands.

112
0:04:00,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And Carl's hands are in luck because the next island is not only warm, but more expensive

113
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
than all of the other islands combined.

114
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:11,000
This island is tiny, but arguably one of the most luxurious ones out there.

115
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Okay let's go check out the house.

116
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Wow.

117
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Oh wow.

118
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We're stoked to have you as our guests.

119
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We hope you have a blast.

120
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Just don't break anything.

121
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Yo we should try to break one thing.

122
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Ooh nice bathroom.

123
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Usually rich people like showers that can fit like thirty to a thousand people in them.

124
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This time they chose a reasonable shower.

125
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:35,000
When you pay sixteen million dollars in addition to a shower that's the size of the one

126
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:36,000
dollar island.

127
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:40,000
The private island comes with this helicopter that's apparently too big for the island.

128
0:04:40,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We have jet skis, we have a submarine, another submarine to the right.

129
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We have a shark submarine over there.

130
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:47,000
There's almost a submarine for each of us.

131
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Boys do whatever you want.

132
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Have fun.

133
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Oh no really bad.

134
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's a little private island.

135
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:00,000
This is gonna walk my car to be to get off of this thing.

136
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Whoa we're under a fish now.

137
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And after Ludwig and Carl kiss the sea at five hundred miles per hour.

138
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We went back to shore to take a little breather.

139
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Yeah Ludwig's gonna jump out of a helicopter.

140
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:19,000
He really is.

141
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:20,000
No I'm not.

142
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Eddie last word.

143
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I love you.

144
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

145
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:32,000
This helicopter is taking the boys up into the air and letting them jump and free fall into the ocean.

146
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Oh my god.

147
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:35,000
This is crazy.

148
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We shouldn't be doing this.

149
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
This is only a sixteen million dollar island and we're jumping out of helicopters.

150
0:05:40,000 --> 0:05:41,000
He's about to jump.

151
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Oh my god.

152
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Oh wait they jump.

153
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:49,000
There it goes.

154
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Whoever said money doesn't buy happiness doesn't own that private island.

155
0:05:58,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Because I'm pretty happy.

156
0:06:00,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And now the forty five million dollar island.

157
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This island is so big you can't even fit it all in frame.

158
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Oh hey.

159
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I didn't even realize they were waiting on us.

160
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I always feel uncomfortable when I pull up the places and people are just standing

161
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
potentially for hours waiting on me.

162
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Hello.

163
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We have some blueberry smoothies here.

164
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Is it alcoholic?

165
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:19,000
No it is not.

166
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:20,000
He's not twenty one.

167
0:06:20,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Now we'll take you guys up and we'll show you around where I live in a little bit.

168
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Let's see what forty five million dollars gets us.

169
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It's a long path.

170
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The path is longer than the lost island.

171
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:32,000
For forty five million dollars this island comes with a mansion

172
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and its own beachside bar and private chef.

173
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Can I give it a flip?

174
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Sure.

175
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Nothing bad.

176
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And outside of the mansion is a hot tub overlooking the cove where the jet skis are.

177
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And of course a pool with the best view I've ever seen.

178
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Does this look as cool on camera as it does in real life?

179
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And if for some reason you don't want to stay in the mansion

180
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
there's five luxury beachside cabanas you can pick from.

181
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Jimmy.

182
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:56,000
May I?

183
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:57,000
You may.

184
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:58,000
May I?

185
0:06:58,000 --> 0:06:59,000
You may.

186
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:00,000
I have class.

187
0:07:00,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But even after messing around with all of the amenities

188
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Why are we playing ping pong when we have an entire island?

189
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It's important to note that that's not what makes this island special.

190
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:13,000
All the way on the other end of the island are sentry old ruins that we are yet to explore.

191
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Tips on driving.

192
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Oh no.

193
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Are you ready?

194
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Yeah!

195
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:20,000
We're going to go on-roading a little bit and head to the back of the island now.

196
0:07:20,000 --> 0:07:21,000
How does Carl always end up driving?

197
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Because I'm also a big bum.

198
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Dude this is like a safari.

199
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Yeah you're going four times the speed limit.

200
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I mean I don't know if there's cops that will stop you but I'm just letting you know.

201
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Is there a jail in this island?

202
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:32,000
No jail.

203
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Oh there's no jail?

204
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And when we finally ran out of road to drive on

205
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:39,000
we started to make our way through what used to be a village of people in this island

206
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:40,000
over a hundred years ago.

207
0:07:40,000 --> 0:07:41,000
This used to be a bar?

208
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Yep.

209
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Yeah you want to walk under this hundred year old giant thousand pound slag?

210
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Sure.

211
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Surely it won't fall on top of you.

212
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Dude if today was the day that it fell you couldn't even be mad.

213
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Nolan come over here before you die.

214
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And just past these ruins is easily the best view on the entire island.

215
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Whoa.

216
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Oh yeah it gets better.

217
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We were driving for so long I forgot we were on an island.

218
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The island starts over there, comes all the way around, wraps all the way around here,

219
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:08,000
goes down that coastline all the way up over there.

220
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I'll be honest I personally wouldn't pay $45 million for a big jungle with some ancient ruins

221
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but I'm sure some rich guy will.

222
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:20,000
This next island is arguably the second most expensive island that money can buy.

223
0:08:20,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This is the $150 million island.

224
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It comes with eight luxurious mega mansions and the best part is it's completely powered

225
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:30,000
by solar panels and wind turbines.

226
0:08:30,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It's home to some of the most exotic animals I've ever seen and took over four decades

227
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to build.

228
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
This island will literally blow your mind.

229
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
When I think of a private island this is what I think of.

230
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
That's good because this is a private island.

231
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:44,000
All right.

232
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And apparently the first thing you need to do here is watch your trip.

233
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:50,000
Make sure you don't taint the island with your outside world germs.

234
0:08:50,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I've already washed my germs.

235
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Does everyone who come here gets a coconut?

236
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I mean they're not running low.

237
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:56,000
True.

238
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:00,000
I don't know if it's because this place is so fancy or maybe they just heard about

239
0:09:00,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Carl's driving.

240
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But each of us ended up with our own personal driver.

241
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I have a feeling this is going to be a once in a lifetime experience.

242
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:08,000
How much did you come back?

243
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I might be out of my price range.

244
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And even though this island costs $150 million you can actually rent it for yourself.

245
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:18,000
For the extremely low price of $140,000 per day.

246
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:20,000
I didn't even realize we just went up a mountain.

247
0:09:20,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I've heard this is the most luxurious private island in the world.

248
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It is.

249
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:25,000
The view is insane.

250
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:26,000
This is the Great House.

251
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But before we were able to explore the Great House my dumb friends got distracted by

252
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:32,000
a turtle.

253
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:33,000
There's a turtle?

254
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Get in there.

255
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Yeah!

256
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:36,000
All right.

257
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
You guys go to the rest of the island.

258
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This island is so extra that for every one person in your party

259
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:44,000
they have ten staff members waiting on your every knee.

260
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
There's a bunch of people over there like here's drinks, here's food.

261
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
What do you want to do over the next two days?

262
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And we're just like turtle.

263
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:50,000
Yeah!

264
0:09:50,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And of course Nolan of all my friends wanted to take advantage of this.

265
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Yeah!

266
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Yeah!

267
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
What's everyone up to over here?

268
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:00,000
We're playing pool with ten people.

269
0:10:00,000 --> 0:10:01,000
They're my hype crew.

270
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Now you don't have to hang out with them to make it feel good.

271
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I will be sad if you don't sit down and relax.

272
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Okay.

273
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
If you need attention don't make them stand up.

274
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:10,000
It's only been an hour but I'll say it.

275
0:10:10,000 --> 0:10:12,000
This is the best island so far.

276
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:16,000
On top of all of that the island has a house with a driving range on the roof where you

277
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
can hit golf balls into the ocean because these are made of fish food.

278
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Ooh.

279
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:26,000
You should probably hit it further so you don't hit someone.

280
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Look at all those flamingos.

281
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:29,000
There's so much I can't process it.

282
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Wow flamingos in the sky.

283
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:32,000
They're everywhere.

284
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They don't love us unless we give them food.

285
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Come here my brethren.

286
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:40,000
But flamingos aren't the only exotic animals on this island.

287
0:10:40,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Whoa.

288
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
That's a dinosaur.

289
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
This is so cool.

290
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And believe it or not this tortoise could live to be over 200 years old.

291
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Mr. tortoise my name is Jimmy.

292
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:55,000
If my descendants descendants descendants come here tell them I was awesome.

293
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And afterwards we got sworn by a bunch of lemurs that live on this island.

294
0:10:58,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Get over here.

295
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Jimmy I don't know if you notice that there's two lemurs on here.

296
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Yeah I know.

297
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I'm trying not to move.

298
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I'll put food on there.

299
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Oh please don't.

300
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:10,000
And if you're wondering where all of these exotic animals came from most of them sadly are endangered

301
0:11:10,000 --> 0:11:14,000
species and are on this island because the owner of Richard Branson brought all of them

302
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
here to prevent them from going extinct.

303
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But the most endangered animals on this island were the mermaids that served a sushi.

304
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Mermaids and sushi.

305
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This is luxury.

306
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Mermaids.

307
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Do you guys want sushi?

308
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I would say nice.

309
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Is that cannibalism?

310
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Yeah.

311
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:30,000
It's like a family reunion.

312
0:11:30,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Get over here.

313
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:34,000
There's honestly so much on this island we can't even film it all.

314
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We played tennis.

315
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We played basketball.

316
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We explored yet another mansion.

317
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I did my first cold plunge.

318
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:40,000
You get the idea.

319
0:11:40,000 --> 0:11:44,000
There's so much to do on this island it's actually overwhelming.

320
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:45,000
This one's actually pretty intense.

321
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I'm like actually scared.

322
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Do you want to know what else is intense?

323
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:49,000
What?

324
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:50,000
The final island.

325
0:11:50,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I'll see you there.

326
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Why are we still here?

327
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And on the way to the 250 million dollar island we stopped in shark infested waters

328
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:00,000
because I have to pay for this video.

329
0:12:00,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And now that I'm surrounded by sharks and what feels like my worst nightmare

330
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I'm going to tell you guys about Stumble Guys.

331
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:07,000
They're so close.

332
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Oh my gosh.

333
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And the worst part is I'm not coming out until I'm done with this ad.

334
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Stumble Guys is a great to play mobile player game where 32 people compete for the crown.

335
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
You have to be an absolute maniac to do this.

336
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:20,000
Not even Stumble Guys could pay me to do this.

337
0:12:20,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Why are you all here sharks?

338
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Oh.

339
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Oh.

340
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:24,000
They're so close.

341
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:25,000
They're so cool.

342
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And for their new season they went all out with new Mr. B skins, animations, and emotes.

343
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Okay it's going right up.

344
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Bro this is the wall.

345
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I want to make sure there's enough sharks for Jimmy.

346
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:41,000
They also added a brand new level but you have to follow a pattern as long as possible to stay alive

347
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and the longer you live the harder it gets.

348
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Oh.

349
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:45,000
The sharks hitting me.

350
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I think the sharks are hitting the cave.

351
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:47,000
No it's rocking.

352
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Oh this is scary.

353
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:50,000
I also just released my brand new toolkit.

354
0:12:50,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So you can build your own Mr. B's level.

355
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:54,000
This is one of their best seasons ever.

356
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
You need to try my new Mr. B's level.

357
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Plus build your own and I want to see what you guys come up with.

358
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Oh the sharks keep hitting the caves.

359
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So I'm going to get out of here.

360
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Make sure you download Stumble Guys for free so I don't have to go back to the shark cage.

361
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:06,000
You're alive.

362
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Let's go do more things that have nothing to do with sharks.

363
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Please.

364
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And now that I've paid off the debt I've incurred from this video

365
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:16,000
let's visit the $250 million island.

366
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:20,000
This is a $250 million private island.

367
0:13:20,000 --> 0:13:26,000
This extraordinary island has an entire amusement park with over a dozen waterslides.

368
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It also has its own hot air balloon and just about every activity you could ever imagine.

369
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And we have it all to ourselves.

370
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
There are no other guests here.

371
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But out of every feature you've seen on these islands so far

372
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
this one stands above the rest.

373
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
In the middle of the island is a massive waterslide.

374
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Even though literal eight year olds ride that waterslide

375
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I might still check it out because I'm afraid it hides.

376
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But before taking on the waterslide

377
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:56,000
we checked out the other features like how there's over a hundred jet skis on this island.

378
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:57,000
It's a bit overkill.

379
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And not to mention there's a literal zip line that spans across man-made beaches.

380
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:03,000
What's the helmet for?

381
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:04,000
What am I going to hit?

382
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:05,000
The ground, bro.

383
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Because sometimes people fall off.

384
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:08,000
This is like really scary.

385
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Good luck.

386
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:10,000
Thank you.

387
0:14:10,000 --> 0:14:12,000
You're kind of far behind.

388
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
This is awesome.

389
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:17,000
This is actually not that crazy.

390
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And if you own this island you can host over 13,000 of your friends

391
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
at any of these five gargantuan pools.

392
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Oh.

393
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:28,000
This kind of looks like it was made in Minecraft.

394
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:30,000
And it's so funny just seeing my two friends in it.

395
0:14:30,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Nolan looks like a tiny speck.

396
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:37,000
For $250 million this island of course has exotic animals.

397
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Is that a peacock?

398
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:40,000
Sir, I need to take you in for questioning.

399
0:14:40,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Sir.

400
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And even every game you can imagine.

401
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I wish there was the 13,000 people that are normally here to watch how bad he is at Cornwall.

402
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:50,000
Is that soccer pool?

403
0:14:50,000 --> 0:14:53,000
This island has things I didn't even know existed.

404
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:58,000
But something I noticed is that there were way too many lifeguards at this island for just the four of us.

405
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:00,000
How many lifeguards are on this island?

406
0:15:00,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Over 100.

407
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Really?

408
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:04,000
With this many lifeguards you would have to try to drown.

409
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:06,000
So I thought it would be fun if we gave them all the day off.

410
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Has anyone ever rented this island before?

411
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:10,000
Wow, this is the first.

412
0:15:10,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Dude, you are leaning back, bro.

413
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:12,000
You look way too relaxed.

414
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And after all the 100 lifeguards went down,

415
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:18,000
they decided to hype up me and the boys for our turn to go down the slide.

416
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Boys, you want to know what's even scarier than that?

417
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
What?

418
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:28,000
That one.

419
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Why is it so terrifying?

420
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:31,000
That looks so scary.

421
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Can we skip it?

422
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Towering at over 135 feet tall.

423
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:41,000
This is the tallest water slide in all of North America.

424
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

425
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:44,000
It's like a skyscraper.

426
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:45,000
But I'm scared.

427
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Daredevil's Peak.

428
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:48,000
What a soothing name.

429
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Very inviting.

430
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Oh, we're so high.

431
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:52,000
It's kind of freaking me out.

432
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:53,000
All right, we made it to the top.

433
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Are you guys just waiting for us up here?

434
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Yeah.

435
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Listen to how intense the wind is up here.

436
0:15:58,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Oh, don't look down.

437
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Look how crazy the island looks.

438
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Oh my God.

439
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Hey, Carl.

440
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:04,000
No.

441
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Oh, Nolan.

442
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Would you say Nose Ghost is enforceable?

443
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Nose Ghost is enforceable.

444
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:09,000
There we go.

445
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:10,000
Hey, the last part's it.

446
0:16:10,000 --> 0:16:11,000
You got to go, Nolan.

447
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I love you, mom.

448
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:14,000
I'll see you on the other side.

449
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:15,000
All right, go.

450
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:20,000
Oh my God.

451
0:16:20,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I got hit by a truck.

452
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Let's do this.

453
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:25,000
You better come down after me.

454
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:26,000
OK.

455
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Oh God.

456
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Why is it so fast?

457
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Is it actually that scary?

458
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
I'm going to do this for your entertainment,

459
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
giant ride scare me.

460
0:16:40,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Here we go.

461
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:44,000
That is going so fast.

462
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And even though I was basically just drowning

463
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:48,000
the entire time down the water slide,

464
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:51,000
I got to say this whole island was pretty awesome.

465
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Oh yeah, and one more thing.
