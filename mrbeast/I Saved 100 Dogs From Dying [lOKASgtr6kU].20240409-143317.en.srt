1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:03,920
In this video, we're going to hope over 100 different stray dogs find a loving home.

2
0:00:03,920 --> 0:00:08,960
Something all of these dogs have in common is that they were abandoned or rescued from kill shelters.

3
0:00:08,960 --> 0:00:12,240
Some of them would have even been dead by the time this video was uploaded.

4
0:00:12,240 --> 0:00:18,240
Which is why I brought all of them here to this massive dog sanctuary to get every one of them adopted.

5
0:00:18,240 --> 0:00:22,320
And to show you how serious we're taking this video, we have an army of trainers,

6
0:00:22,320 --> 0:00:26,720
walkers, and even an entire team dedicated to giving the dogs scratches.

7
0:00:26,720 --> 0:00:29,920
Make sure they get lots of love. I want the doggos happy.

8
0:00:29,920 --> 0:00:34,160
And the doggos were happy, especially once the first adopter showed up.

9
0:00:34,160 --> 0:00:35,440
Welcome, come on in.

10
0:00:35,440 --> 0:00:36,320
What?

11
0:00:36,320 --> 0:00:38,800
You're going to adopt a dog even though you already have one?

12
0:00:38,800 --> 0:00:41,680
Yes, we want a small dog to be friends with this guy.

13
0:00:41,680 --> 0:00:44,480
And if you're wondering where these two random people came from,

14
0:00:44,480 --> 0:00:48,640
we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a statewide ad campaign

15
0:00:48,640 --> 0:00:50,720
to get as many people here as possible.

16
0:00:50,720 --> 0:00:51,920
What do you think of biscuit?

17
0:00:51,920 --> 0:00:52,720
Oh, she's cute.

18
0:00:52,720 --> 0:00:55,600
If you're interested, we can take them to the park and let them play together.

19
0:00:55,600 --> 0:00:57,360
Yes, that would be amazing.

20
0:00:57,360 --> 0:00:58,800
Oh, they're running together.

21
0:00:58,800 --> 0:01:00,400
Yes, we love her.

22
0:01:00,400 --> 0:01:02,000
You want to proceed to the next step?

23
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:03,520
Yes, please.

24
0:01:03,520 --> 0:01:05,680
We love her so much.

25
0:01:05,680 --> 0:01:07,680
One down, 99 more to go.

26
0:01:07,680 --> 0:01:09,280
Oh, we got a runaway dog.

27
0:01:09,280 --> 0:01:10,480
We got you quartered.

28
0:01:10,480 --> 0:01:11,840
They're all cheering him on.

29
0:01:11,840 --> 0:01:14,160
All right, whoever adopts Rocky, good luck.

30
0:01:14,160 --> 0:01:15,200
He's very energetic.

31
0:01:15,200 --> 0:01:18,000
And you should know that every person that wants to adopt a dog,

32
0:01:18,880 --> 0:01:19,920
all right, you're free, Barkley.

33
0:01:19,920 --> 0:01:20,960
Oh, he's great.

34
0:01:20,960 --> 0:01:21,760
I think we're going to do it.

35
0:01:21,760 --> 0:01:23,840
His first put through extensive background checks

36
0:01:23,840 --> 0:01:25,600
by an independent third-party person

37
0:01:25,600 --> 0:01:29,040
to make sure they'll be able to provide a safe, stable, and loving home.

38
0:01:29,040 --> 0:01:30,240
Barkley's been officially adopted.

39
0:01:30,240 --> 0:01:30,480
Thank you.

40
0:01:30,480 --> 0:01:31,840
Congratulations.

41
0:01:31,840 --> 0:01:33,200
And when the next family came in,

42
0:01:33,200 --> 0:01:34,560
let's go find you guys a dog.

43
0:01:34,560 --> 0:01:36,160
They noticed the dog right away.

44
0:01:36,160 --> 0:01:37,600
Oh, look at this.

45
0:01:37,600 --> 0:01:38,160
He's ready.

46
0:01:38,160 --> 0:01:39,120
How many of them?

47
0:01:39,120 --> 0:01:40,560
As many as you can carry, baby.

48
0:01:40,560 --> 0:01:41,360
Charlie and Nugget.

49
0:01:41,360 --> 0:01:43,120
Oh, they're getting along so well.

50
0:01:43,120 --> 0:01:45,200
And after saying bye to Nugget and Charlie,

51
0:01:45,200 --> 0:01:46,880
things began to pick up.

52
0:01:46,880 --> 0:01:48,000
Hi, I'm Carl.

53
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:49,200
You want to meet a dog instead of me?

54
0:01:49,200 --> 0:01:50,640
Yeah, that's kind of why I'm here.

55
0:01:50,640 --> 0:01:51,520
I'm Chandler.

56
0:01:51,520 --> 0:01:52,240
Nice to meet you.

57
0:01:52,240 --> 0:01:52,880
How's it going?

58
0:01:52,880 --> 0:01:53,440
I'm Jimmy.

59
0:01:53,440 --> 0:01:54,160
Oh.

60
0:01:54,160 --> 0:01:56,400
You strike me as someone who'd like brownie.

61
0:01:56,400 --> 0:01:58,000
He's cute.

62
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:00,480
It's the end of day one, and eight dogs got adopted.

63
0:02:00,480 --> 0:02:02,080
But obviously, the cute, fluffy dogs

64
0:02:02,080 --> 0:02:03,760
are easy to find homes for.

65
0:02:03,760 --> 0:02:07,040
Getting all 100 dogs adopted could literally take months.

66
0:02:07,040 --> 0:02:09,520
But at least on day two, thanks to our ad campaign,

67
0:02:09,520 --> 0:02:12,160
we had 10 times the amount of people waiting.

68
0:02:12,160 --> 0:02:13,040
Oh, my god.

69
0:02:13,040 --> 0:02:13,920
Here's a cute puppy.

70
0:02:13,920 --> 0:02:14,880
You want to play with them?

71
0:02:14,880 --> 0:02:15,840
Oh, my gosh.

72
0:02:15,840 --> 0:02:17,600
The objective is to hit them with a cute puppy

73
0:02:17,600 --> 0:02:18,560
when they walk in the door.

74
0:02:18,560 --> 0:02:19,680
Seems to be working.

75
0:02:19,760 --> 0:02:20,480
I like this one.

76
0:02:20,480 --> 0:02:21,200
Oh, I love you.

77
0:02:21,200 --> 0:02:22,000
You want to take hands?

78
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:22,560
Let's do that.

79
0:02:24,240 --> 0:02:25,440
There's so many people in here.

80
0:02:25,440 --> 0:02:26,240
I don't know what to do.

81
0:02:26,240 --> 0:02:27,520
Oh, my god.

82
0:02:27,520 --> 0:02:28,960
I'm taking this dog home.

83
0:02:28,960 --> 0:02:29,440
OK.

84
0:02:29,440 --> 0:02:29,920
There we go.

85
0:02:29,920 --> 0:02:31,120
Another one adopted.

86
0:02:31,120 --> 0:02:32,880
In case you're wondering, these X's

87
0:02:32,880 --> 0:02:34,560
don't mean the dogs died.

88
0:02:34,560 --> 0:02:35,840
It means they got adopted.

89
0:02:35,840 --> 0:02:36,720
I want both.

90
0:02:36,720 --> 0:02:38,560
See if you can convince them to adopt two dogs.

91
0:02:38,560 --> 0:02:40,320
There is a buy one, get one free rule.

92
0:02:40,320 --> 0:02:41,120
They're both free.

93
0:02:41,120 --> 0:02:42,240
They're both free, actually.

94
0:02:42,240 --> 0:02:43,200
Let's get these two.

95
0:02:43,200 --> 0:02:45,600
I think you are the one for me, baby.

96
0:02:45,600 --> 0:02:46,400
We rollin'.

97
0:02:46,400 --> 0:02:47,200
Rocky out.

98
0:02:47,200 --> 0:02:49,120
Chandler is introducing people to dogs.

99
0:02:49,120 --> 0:02:50,720
Carl's hanging out with the people in the park

100
0:02:50,720 --> 0:02:52,240
to make sure they don't steal the dogs.

101
0:02:52,240 --> 0:02:53,600
And Nolan is the closer

102
0:02:53,600 --> 0:02:55,120
in making sure they adopt the dogs.

103
0:02:55,120 --> 0:02:57,200
Plus, we have like 50 other people running around

104
0:02:57,200 --> 0:02:58,320
doing everything in their power

105
0:02:58,320 --> 0:02:59,520
to find these dogs' homes.

106
0:02:59,520 --> 0:03:01,440
We have a well-oiled machine running

107
0:03:01,440 --> 0:03:03,600
and we will get all these dogs a loving home.

108
0:03:03,600 --> 0:03:05,520
And on top of that, every adopter

109
0:03:05,520 --> 0:03:06,880
gets an additional surprise.

110
0:03:06,880 --> 0:03:09,200
So are you guys certain you want to adopt Thor?

111
0:03:09,200 --> 0:03:09,600
Yep.

112
0:03:09,600 --> 0:03:10,320
Pretty much.

113
0:03:10,320 --> 0:03:11,840
Then I have a surprise for you.

114
0:03:11,840 --> 0:03:13,520
Every dog that gets adopted,

115
0:03:13,520 --> 0:03:15,840
they also come with free pet food for life.

116
0:03:15,840 --> 0:03:16,800
Oh, I should probably turn this way.

117
0:03:16,800 --> 0:03:17,520
You can see it.

118
0:03:17,520 --> 0:03:18,720
Free pet food for life.

119
0:03:18,800 --> 0:03:20,640
And head insurance for life.

120
0:03:20,640 --> 0:03:21,600
Get out.

121
0:03:21,600 --> 0:03:23,120
I think I'm gonna cry.

122
0:03:23,120 --> 0:03:24,400
Do we get to food for life?

123
0:03:24,400 --> 0:03:26,640
You guys are not coming with human food for life.

124
0:03:26,640 --> 0:03:28,080
Thanks to Spot and Jinx,

125
0:03:28,080 --> 0:03:30,320
we were able to provide premium pet food

126
0:03:30,320 --> 0:03:32,400
and insurance for all 100 dogs.

127
0:03:32,400 --> 0:03:33,120
Let's go.

128
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:35,920
Which literally means free dog food

129
0:03:35,920 --> 0:03:37,120
shows up at their door

130
0:03:37,120 --> 0:03:39,360
for the entire life of the dog.

131
0:03:39,360 --> 0:03:40,720
Oh my God.

132
0:03:40,720 --> 0:03:41,600
Look at that.

133
0:03:41,600 --> 0:03:42,880
Thank you.

134
0:03:42,880 --> 0:03:45,120
What kind of angel is doing this?

135
0:03:45,120 --> 0:03:46,080
It's my friend Jimmy.

136
0:03:46,080 --> 0:03:47,280
Well, tell your friend Jimmy.

137
0:03:47,280 --> 0:03:47,920
Thank you.

138
0:03:47,920 --> 0:03:49,440
But that was when I met this woman

139
0:03:49,440 --> 0:03:50,960
who really stood out to me

140
0:03:50,960 --> 0:03:52,320
having previously adopted

141
0:03:52,320 --> 0:03:53,920
six other dogs in her lifetime.

142
0:03:53,920 --> 0:03:56,080
And so we took her to see some dogs

143
0:03:56,080 --> 0:03:58,480
but she fell in love with Zoe right away.

144
0:03:58,480 --> 0:03:59,200
That's her Dane

145
0:03:59,200 --> 0:04:00,960
and she's gonna meet Zoe for the first time.

146
0:04:00,960 --> 0:04:02,240
Let's see if they get along well.

147
0:04:03,040 --> 0:04:03,760
The butt sniffs.

148
0:04:03,760 --> 0:04:04,480
That's a good sign.

149
0:04:04,480 --> 0:04:06,800
We need you to be extra nice to Zoe, okay?

150
0:04:06,800 --> 0:04:08,000
Look at them running around.

151
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:09,840
Zoe's gonna be extra happy in this new home.

152
0:04:09,840 --> 0:04:10,960
Because now with Zoe,

153
0:04:10,960 --> 0:04:13,200
she will be caring for a total of seven dogs.

154
0:04:13,200 --> 0:04:14,080
Oh awesome.

155
0:04:14,080 --> 0:04:15,120
We want to surprise her

156
0:04:15,120 --> 0:04:16,400
with a little something extra.

157
0:04:16,400 --> 0:04:19,280
We're also gonna give you $10,000 in cash.

158
0:04:19,280 --> 0:04:20,080
Get out.

159
0:04:20,080 --> 0:04:22,560
As long as you promise to give her lots of scratches.

160
0:04:22,560 --> 0:04:23,680
I do that for nothing.

161
0:04:23,680 --> 0:04:24,880
Well, now you're doing it for 10 grand?

162
0:04:24,880 --> 0:04:25,520
To nowhere.

163
0:04:25,520 --> 0:04:26,080
No problem.

164
0:04:26,080 --> 0:04:27,520
Uh-oh.

165
0:04:27,520 --> 0:04:29,200
I've rescued so many babies.

166
0:04:29,200 --> 0:04:30,400
Because I just love them

167
0:04:30,400 --> 0:04:32,080
and they deserve a good home.

168
0:04:32,080 --> 0:04:33,040
Yeah, absolutely.

169
0:04:33,040 --> 0:04:34,080
You're gonna give her a great home.

170
0:04:34,080 --> 0:04:34,800
We know that.

171
0:04:34,800 --> 0:04:37,040
And even though it was a chaotic day,

172
0:04:37,040 --> 0:04:38,000
by the end of day two,

173
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:40,000
we had 44 dogs adopted.

174
0:04:40,000 --> 0:04:41,680
But we noticed that there was one dog

175
0:04:41,680 --> 0:04:43,520
who got passed up by more families

176
0:04:43,520 --> 0:04:44,720
than any other that day.

177
0:04:44,720 --> 0:04:45,920
This dog's name is Buffett.

178
0:04:45,920 --> 0:04:47,120
He only has three legs

179
0:04:47,120 --> 0:04:48,880
because sadly he was hit by a car.

180
0:04:48,880 --> 0:04:50,160
Which unfortunately means

181
0:04:50,160 --> 0:04:51,840
he just may be the hardest dog

182
0:04:51,840 --> 0:04:53,520
out of 100 to find a home for.

183
0:04:53,520 --> 0:04:55,440
So this is my favorite dog over here.

184
0:04:55,440 --> 0:04:56,640
His name is Buffett.

185
0:04:56,640 --> 0:04:58,960
He only has three legs.

186
0:04:58,960 --> 0:05:00,160
But luckily for Buffett,

187
0:05:00,160 --> 0:05:02,320
we had a few new strategies for tomorrow.

188
0:05:02,320 --> 0:05:03,440
Because on day three,

189
0:05:03,440 --> 0:05:05,920
we still have over 50 dogs to get adopted.

190
0:05:05,920 --> 0:05:07,440
So the first strategy we used

191
0:05:07,440 --> 0:05:08,960
is I let everyone into the park

192
0:05:08,960 --> 0:05:10,480
and unleashed all of the dogs

193
0:05:10,480 --> 0:05:12,320
so that they could choose their own families.

194
0:05:12,320 --> 0:05:14,000
You got a camera and you're the cameraman.

195
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:15,280
This is beautiful.

196
0:05:15,360 --> 0:05:16,720
Have you decided on the baby's name?

197
0:05:16,720 --> 0:05:18,160
All right, see we thought that was Hershey.

198
0:05:18,160 --> 0:05:19,360
Good dog named Bad Chocolate.

199
0:05:20,000 --> 0:05:21,200
Yeah, you can just jump in there.

200
0:05:21,200 --> 0:05:21,920
We won't lock you in.

201
0:05:23,120 --> 0:05:25,120
All right, you can't leave until you adopt her now.

202
0:05:25,120 --> 0:05:25,600
So what do you say?

203
0:05:25,600 --> 0:05:26,640
You want to get the leash?

204
0:05:26,640 --> 0:05:27,520
Yeah, I want to.

205
0:05:27,520 --> 0:05:28,720
All right, arms up.

206
0:05:28,720 --> 0:05:29,200
I'm just kidding.

207
0:05:29,200 --> 0:05:30,320
It's a perfect match here.

208
0:05:30,320 --> 0:05:31,440
You think this might be the one?

209
0:05:31,440 --> 0:05:32,160
I think so.

210
0:05:32,160 --> 0:05:33,600
You want to go home with me?

211
0:05:33,600 --> 0:05:34,480
She's so cute.

212
0:05:34,480 --> 0:05:35,360
And since we were getting

213
0:05:35,360 --> 0:05:36,960
pretty good at adopting dogs,

214
0:05:36,960 --> 0:05:38,640
it was time to have a little fun with it.

215
0:05:38,640 --> 0:05:39,120
Boys.

216
0:05:39,120 --> 0:05:40,080
What am I doing?

217
0:05:40,080 --> 0:05:42,000
Lay down and pretend to be asleep

218
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:42,800
whenever they...

219
0:05:42,800 --> 0:05:44,640
Oh, she just came in.

220
0:05:44,640 --> 0:05:45,120
All right.

221
0:05:47,120 --> 0:05:48,240
Stay asleep.

222
0:05:48,240 --> 0:05:48,640
Hold on.

223
0:05:50,720 --> 0:05:51,520
Is he asleep?

224
0:05:51,520 --> 0:05:52,480
Yeah, he's taking a nap.

225
0:05:54,480 --> 0:05:55,440
He just tucked him in.

226
0:05:57,920 --> 0:06:00,400
Now get up and say guess snap time's over.

227
0:06:00,400 --> 0:06:01,840
Guess snap time's over.

228
0:06:01,840 --> 0:06:02,880
And now go back to sleep.

229
0:06:04,640 --> 0:06:06,240
They think he's crazy.

230
0:06:06,240 --> 0:06:06,720
Look here.

231
0:06:09,840 --> 0:06:10,960
But all jokes aside,

232
0:06:10,960 --> 0:06:12,480
the good news is we're finally

233
0:06:12,480 --> 0:06:14,240
getting more people to see Buffett.

234
0:06:14,560 --> 0:06:15,680
He likes you guys.

235
0:06:15,680 --> 0:06:17,520
Buffett might be about to find a family.

236
0:06:17,520 --> 0:06:18,800
But unfortunately...

237
0:06:18,800 --> 0:06:20,000
Are you thinking Tanner or Buffett?

238
0:06:20,000 --> 0:06:20,800
Can I get Tanner?

239
0:06:20,800 --> 0:06:22,240
Do you want to take Buffett back?

240
0:06:22,240 --> 0:06:23,520
Yeah, I think so.

241
0:06:23,520 --> 0:06:24,960
Then we'll go take a look at a couple more.

242
0:06:24,960 --> 0:06:25,440
Okay.

243
0:06:25,440 --> 0:06:27,280
And so we tried again with these two.

244
0:06:27,280 --> 0:06:28,480
He's a sweetheart.

245
0:06:28,480 --> 0:06:30,080
And he actually gets around really well.

246
0:06:30,080 --> 0:06:31,200
But once again...

247
0:06:31,200 --> 0:06:32,400
So you don't want Buffett?

248
0:06:32,400 --> 0:06:33,200
I can't take him.

249
0:06:33,200 --> 0:06:34,000
Yeah, come on, good boy.

250
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:34,960
And to be honest guys,

251
0:06:34,960 --> 0:06:37,200
this whole situation made us really sad.

252
0:06:37,200 --> 0:06:39,200
Which is why we spent 50 grand

253
0:06:39,200 --> 0:06:41,840
on a customized Buffett marketing campaign.

254
0:06:41,840 --> 0:06:44,720
We will not rest until Buffett has a loving home.

255
0:06:44,720 --> 0:06:47,040
As you can see, all the younger dogs are adopted.

256
0:06:47,040 --> 0:06:50,240
People are just not looking to adopt older dogs as much.

257
0:06:50,240 --> 0:06:51,920
And since that's all we have left,

258
0:06:51,920 --> 0:06:53,920
the further we go, the harder this gets.

259
0:06:53,920 --> 0:06:56,720
Some of these dogs are from a facility called a kill shelter.

260
0:06:56,720 --> 0:06:58,880
And because they are unable to refuse any animals,

261
0:06:58,880 --> 0:07:00,560
they are often over capacity

262
0:07:00,560 --> 0:07:02,960
and have to put down their dogs to make space for more.

263
0:07:02,960 --> 0:07:04,960
But fortunately, that's not going to happen.

264
0:07:04,960 --> 0:07:06,720
And up next, we're on day number four.

265
0:07:06,720 --> 0:07:08,400
And this time we have Dave Patista,

266
0:07:08,400 --> 0:07:10,560
who you might recognize from Guardians of the Galaxy.

267
0:07:11,200 --> 0:07:12,400
This one's your favorite?

268
0:07:12,400 --> 0:07:13,600
She's so loving.

269
0:07:13,600 --> 0:07:14,800
She's working her magic.

270
0:07:15,680 --> 0:07:16,800
Don't give me that look.

271
0:07:16,800 --> 0:07:19,120
She's like, come on, why don't you adopt me?

272
0:07:19,120 --> 0:07:20,400
You're usually the adopter.

273
0:07:20,400 --> 0:07:22,400
Yeah, hey four, I'll rescue you.

274
0:07:22,400 --> 0:07:23,520
Might be five soon.

275
0:07:23,520 --> 0:07:23,760
Yeah.

276
0:07:24,560 --> 0:07:26,240
Look at us, we both look super defined.

277
0:07:26,240 --> 0:07:26,960
Thank you.

278
0:07:26,960 --> 0:07:28,320
And now that he looked apart,

279
0:07:28,320 --> 0:07:30,720
it was time for Dave's official initiation.

280
0:07:30,720 --> 0:07:32,240
This time Dave's doing the adoption.

281
0:07:32,240 --> 0:07:33,680
Let's see how good of an actor he is.

282
0:07:33,680 --> 0:07:35,040
Dave, when they walk in,

283
0:07:35,040 --> 0:07:36,880
bark and woof to them as a dog.

284
0:07:36,880 --> 0:07:38,160
It's an everyday thing for me.

285
0:07:38,960 --> 0:07:41,760
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.

286
0:07:41,760 --> 0:07:43,280
All right, kids.

287
0:07:45,280 --> 0:07:46,480
Hello, how are you?

288
0:07:46,480 --> 0:07:49,120
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.

289
0:07:49,120 --> 0:07:50,160
All right, you can stop.

290
0:07:50,160 --> 0:07:50,880
You can stop.

291
0:07:50,880 --> 0:07:52,240
I don't want to make it too hard on him.

292
0:07:52,240 --> 0:07:53,040
Sorry for barking.

293
0:07:53,040 --> 0:07:54,320
I've been speaking to dogs all day.

294
0:07:54,320 --> 0:07:55,520
I think we have a prize for you.

295
0:07:55,520 --> 0:07:57,200
We have a huge prize for you guys.

296
0:07:58,320 --> 0:08:00,800
Free pet food for life from Jinx.

297
0:08:00,800 --> 0:08:04,320
And we also have pet insurance for life for your pup.

298
0:08:04,320 --> 0:08:04,560
Yeah.

299
0:08:04,560 --> 0:08:06,160
Oh wow, that's amazing.

300
0:08:06,160 --> 0:08:08,480
But wait, there's actually one more surprise.

301
0:08:08,480 --> 0:08:09,840
There's actually one more surprise.

302
0:08:09,840 --> 0:08:11,600
And then go to the beach, painting,

303
0:08:11,600 --> 0:08:13,680
turn it around and show them what it says on the back.

304
0:08:14,320 --> 0:08:15,120
Can I get the picture?

305
0:08:19,360 --> 0:08:20,000
Thanks, guys.

306
0:08:21,120 --> 0:08:22,800
With Dave now a part of the team,

307
0:08:22,800 --> 0:08:25,280
we were adopting dogs faster than ever before.

308
0:08:25,920 --> 0:08:26,640
How's it going?

309
0:08:27,520 --> 0:08:28,320
They're so cute.

310
0:08:28,320 --> 0:08:29,440
Are you taking both of them?

311
0:08:29,440 --> 0:08:30,240
Yeah, you're not.

312
0:08:30,240 --> 0:08:31,280
You can't separate them.

313
0:08:31,280 --> 0:08:32,240
Let's go get the paperwork ready.

314
0:08:32,240 --> 0:08:32,800
Let's do it.

315
0:08:33,440 --> 0:08:34,240
And soon enough,

316
0:08:34,240 --> 0:08:38,080
we were approaching the final 10 and hardest to get adopted dogs.

317
0:08:38,080 --> 0:08:39,120
Hi, baby.

318
0:08:39,120 --> 0:08:39,600
Yeah.

319
0:08:39,600 --> 0:08:40,960
So Dave, you keep coming back to her.

320
0:08:40,960 --> 0:08:41,600
What's going on?

321
0:08:41,600 --> 0:08:42,560
I have a dog named Penny.

322
0:08:42,560 --> 0:08:43,760
She reminds me of her so much.

323
0:08:43,760 --> 0:08:45,920
So it's already feeling like we're connected.

324
0:08:45,920 --> 0:08:47,280
I hate seeing her out of home.

325
0:08:47,280 --> 0:08:48,160
She's killing me.

326
0:08:48,160 --> 0:08:49,760
If no one takes her home, I'll take her.

327
0:08:49,760 --> 0:08:51,200
If no one adopts her, you'll take her?

328
0:08:51,200 --> 0:08:51,920
I'll adopt her, yeah.

329
0:08:51,920 --> 0:08:53,200
All right, I'm going to hold you to that.

330
0:08:53,200 --> 0:08:54,720
She's going to have a home no matter what.

331
0:08:54,720 --> 0:08:56,160
And it wasn't just Dorely.

332
0:08:56,160 --> 0:08:58,080
After getting passed up again and again

333
0:08:58,080 --> 0:08:59,440
by families all day,

334
0:08:59,440 --> 0:09:01,600
Buffett seemed like he was starting to lose hope.

335
0:09:01,600 --> 0:09:03,680
But then something unexpected happened.

336
0:09:03,680 --> 0:09:05,200
Buffett seemed pretty cool.

337
0:09:05,200 --> 0:09:07,200
My grandpa had a three-legged dog

338
0:09:07,200 --> 0:09:08,400
and take him for a walk.

339
0:09:08,400 --> 0:09:08,640
Yeah.

340
0:09:08,640 --> 0:09:10,800
Buffett seemed to warm up to this guy right away.

341
0:09:10,800 --> 0:09:11,840
I'm going to hop along.

342
0:09:11,840 --> 0:09:13,280
Someone might adopt Buffett.

343
0:09:13,280 --> 0:09:15,280
Buffett had a lot of fun running around

344
0:09:15,280 --> 0:09:18,160
and this guy didn't seem phased by his missing leg at all.

345
0:09:18,160 --> 0:09:20,080
So I've seen three-legged dogs do pretty good.

346
0:09:20,080 --> 0:09:21,600
I'm feeling really good about this time.

347
0:09:21,600 --> 0:09:23,600
I think Buffett is about to find a new home.

348
0:09:23,600 --> 0:09:24,800
You want to go home with Buffett?

349
0:09:24,800 --> 0:09:26,240
Yeah, I think he's a good dog.

350
0:09:26,880 --> 0:09:30,720
And to ensure that Buffett had the best possible quality of life moving forward,

351
0:09:30,720 --> 0:09:33,600
we also had a custom prosthetic leg made for him.

352
0:09:33,600 --> 0:09:36,560
And we're able to give his adopter $10,000.

353
0:09:37,840 --> 0:09:38,160
Wow.

354
0:09:39,440 --> 0:09:40,800
Buffett found the home.

355
0:09:40,800 --> 0:09:42,240
Now we got to get rid of his kennel.

356
0:09:42,240 --> 0:09:44,080
Buffett, we miss you already.

357
0:09:44,080 --> 0:09:44,960
It's bittersweet,

358
0:09:44,960 --> 0:09:47,760
but it finally feels good to take down his kennel.

359
0:09:47,760 --> 0:09:48,800
We'll miss you, Buffett.

360
0:09:50,240 --> 0:09:52,080
It's now the start of day five.

361
0:09:52,080 --> 0:09:53,840
Only 10 doggos remain.

362
0:09:53,840 --> 0:09:55,840
We've made some very serious progress.

363
0:09:55,840 --> 0:09:57,440
As there's less dogs,

364
0:09:57,440 --> 0:09:59,360
there's less options for people to choose from.

365
0:09:59,360 --> 0:10:01,680
So obviously this is going to get harder.

366
0:10:01,680 --> 0:10:04,880
And to kick off today, I brought two of my friends who are looking to adopt dogs.

367
0:10:04,880 --> 0:10:07,360
You might know Neil because he lost a million dollars in our videos.

368
0:10:07,360 --> 0:10:10,400
You might know Dustin because he lost $10,000 like five years ago.

369
0:10:10,400 --> 0:10:11,440
It's a lot better than a million.

370
0:10:12,160 --> 0:10:13,760
And while you're looking for dogs,

371
0:10:13,760 --> 0:10:16,960
because I've spent over $2 million dollars getting dogs adopted,

372
0:10:16,960 --> 0:10:19,040
and don't plan on slowing down anytime soon,

373
0:10:19,040 --> 0:10:22,240
please for the love of God, can I tell you about Surfshark?

374
0:10:22,240 --> 0:10:22,640
Of course.

375
0:10:22,640 --> 0:10:23,600
I'd rather look at the dogs.

376
0:10:23,600 --> 0:10:26,080
Surfshark is a private network provider, VPN,

377
0:10:26,080 --> 0:10:28,720
that lets you access content not available in your location,

378
0:10:28,720 --> 0:10:31,120
as well as browse the web safely and securely.

379
0:10:31,120 --> 0:10:36,080
Surfshark was also kind enough to give this shelter $50,000 to help save more dogs.

380
0:10:36,080 --> 0:10:37,360
So you should watch this ad.

381
0:10:37,360 --> 0:10:38,480
What do you think of Coco?

382
0:10:38,480 --> 0:10:38,880
I think Coco.

383
0:10:38,880 --> 0:10:40,000
Here, tell me in one second.

384
0:10:40,000 --> 0:10:42,640
Sometimes content is only available in a specific country.

385
0:10:42,640 --> 0:10:45,520
Luckily Surfshark has 3,000 servers in 100 different countries,

386
0:10:45,520 --> 0:10:48,400
so you can watch movies or shows that aren't specifically available in yours.

387
0:10:48,400 --> 0:10:49,280
Anyways, what were you saying?

388
0:10:49,280 --> 0:10:50,560
Tell me more about the VPN.

389
0:10:50,560 --> 0:10:51,280
Oh, I already did.

390
0:10:51,280 --> 0:10:52,640
You want to take Jet Offer Walk?

391
0:10:52,640 --> 0:10:53,200
Please?

392
0:10:53,200 --> 0:10:53,840
Yeah, let's do it.

393
0:10:53,840 --> 0:10:55,600
And with Surfshark's alternative ID,

394
0:10:55,600 --> 0:10:57,200
you can disguise things like your address,

395
0:10:57,200 --> 0:10:58,800
email, and phone numbers from hackers.

396
0:10:58,800 --> 0:10:59,440
You're free!

397
0:10:59,440 --> 0:11:00,160
Oh, look at them all.

398
0:11:00,160 --> 0:11:01,440
Oh my goodness.

399
0:11:01,440 --> 0:11:02,400
What's the verdict?

400
0:11:02,400 --> 0:11:03,840
I love playing with this dog,

401
0:11:03,840 --> 0:11:05,680
and I want to keep playing with this dog forever.

402
0:11:05,680 --> 0:11:06,400
Good enough for me.

403
0:11:06,400 --> 0:11:07,600
You think you're going to get Jet?

404
0:11:07,600 --> 0:11:09,280
I'm absolutely getting Zeus.

405
0:11:09,280 --> 0:11:10,480
Oh, his name's Zeus now.

406
0:11:10,480 --> 0:11:11,440
Hey, good enough for me.

407
0:11:11,440 --> 0:11:14,160
Did you know if they use discount code MrBeast on Surfshark,

408
0:11:14,160 --> 0:11:15,760
they can get up to 83% off

409
0:11:15,760 --> 0:11:17,680
and have six months added to their subscription?

410
0:11:17,680 --> 0:11:18,720
Are you kidding me?

411
0:11:18,720 --> 0:11:21,520
On top of that, Surfshark has a 30-day money-back guarantee,

412
0:11:21,520 --> 0:11:24,400
so there's literally no reason not to install and give it a try right now.

413
0:11:24,400 --> 0:11:25,680
You're stupid if you don't.

414
0:11:25,680 --> 0:11:26,480
Neil, don't worry.

415
0:11:26,480 --> 0:11:28,080
You don't have to share checks with him,

416
0:11:28,080 --> 0:11:29,760
because we have our own checks for you.

417
0:11:29,760 --> 0:11:30,720
Let's go.

418
0:11:30,720 --> 0:11:32,960
Eight dogs remained, and we're going to go find them at home.

419
0:11:32,960 --> 0:11:34,320
Jimmy, how do I cash these?

420
0:11:34,320 --> 0:11:37,040
As we had hoped as more and more people came in,

421
0:11:37,040 --> 0:11:39,120
some were showing interest in our older dogs.

422
0:11:39,120 --> 0:11:40,080
It's Dexter Shepherd.

423
0:11:40,080 --> 0:11:41,600
Are you interested in a shepherd?

424
0:11:41,600 --> 0:11:43,200
Yes, that is exactly what I was interested in.

425
0:11:43,200 --> 0:11:44,400
Oh, look at it.

426
0:11:44,400 --> 0:11:47,200
We've got two boys, so I think we need, like, a girl.

427
0:11:47,200 --> 0:11:49,040
She's ready to come out.

428
0:11:49,040 --> 0:11:50,800
Hi, pretty girl.

429
0:11:50,800 --> 0:11:52,240
So you made up your mind about Dexter,

430
0:11:52,240 --> 0:11:52,800
you're taking them home.

431
0:11:52,800 --> 0:11:54,240
Oh yeah, I'm taking Dexter.

432
0:11:54,240 --> 0:11:55,680
I think we need her in our life.

433
0:11:55,680 --> 0:11:56,560
They're so happy.

434
0:11:56,560 --> 0:11:59,120
So as we remove some of the final dog's kennels,

435
0:11:59,120 --> 0:12:02,080
we started to receive video footage from all of the families

436
0:12:02,080 --> 0:12:04,320
who had adopted these dogs so far.

437
0:12:04,320 --> 0:12:06,400
And she's loving her new life here.

438
0:12:06,400 --> 0:12:09,600
Cooper has been a great addition to our family.

439
0:12:09,600 --> 0:12:10,720
This is Hazel.

440
0:12:10,720 --> 0:12:13,040
So far, she is doing amazing.

441
0:12:13,040 --> 0:12:13,600
Hi, Sam.

442
0:12:13,600 --> 0:12:15,200
Oh, you got belly rubbed.

443
0:12:15,200 --> 0:12:15,920
Good boy.

444
0:12:17,920 --> 0:12:19,760
Thank you for the puppies, Miss Obie.

445
0:12:20,320 --> 0:12:22,320
And it was really beautiful.

446
0:12:22,320 --> 0:12:23,360
At the start of this video,

447
0:12:23,360 --> 0:12:26,240
we had 100 dogs that had been left in kill shelters

448
0:12:26,240 --> 0:12:28,560
or abandoned, but now only two remain,

449
0:12:28,560 --> 0:12:30,960
leaving us with Star Crunch and Dora Lee.

450
0:12:30,960 --> 0:12:32,720
And while people are coming to adopt,

451
0:12:32,720 --> 0:12:34,960
neither dog seemed to fit what they were looking for.

452
0:12:34,960 --> 0:12:36,560
For a small dog, that's great.

453
0:12:36,560 --> 0:12:38,480
We don't actually have any small dogs left.

454
0:12:38,480 --> 0:12:40,640
I was really looking for, like, the younger dog.

455
0:12:40,640 --> 0:12:41,440
Yeah, don't worry.

456
0:12:41,440 --> 0:12:42,880
Do you guys have any small dogs?

457
0:12:42,880 --> 0:12:44,320
Sadly, we don't have any more.

458
0:12:44,320 --> 0:12:47,040
We were starting to worry that we wouldn't find these to a home,

459
0:12:47,040 --> 0:12:49,280
and there was nothing left to do but wait.

460
0:12:49,280 --> 0:12:52,960
Star Crunch and Dora Lee.

461
0:12:55,120 --> 0:12:56,480
Oh, how's it going?

462
0:12:56,480 --> 0:12:57,040
What up?

463
0:12:57,040 --> 0:12:57,520
Hi.

464
0:12:57,520 --> 0:12:58,960
These are our final two.

465
0:12:58,960 --> 0:13:00,480
It's like the last pick in dodgeball.

466
0:13:00,480 --> 0:13:01,280
I'm looking for this one.

467
0:13:01,280 --> 0:13:03,360
All right, Star Crunch can be incredibly shy

468
0:13:03,360 --> 0:13:04,320
when she needs new people,

469
0:13:04,320 --> 0:13:06,880
but Star Crunch gravitated right to them.

470
0:13:06,880 --> 0:13:07,840
We'll call you Crunch.

471
0:13:07,840 --> 0:13:09,120
We'll win them over, Crunch.

472
0:13:09,120 --> 0:13:11,040
You're watching all these dogs get adopted.

473
0:13:11,040 --> 0:13:12,720
No, Dora Lee.

474
0:13:12,720 --> 0:13:14,160
And even though it was exciting to watch

475
0:13:14,160 --> 0:13:15,520
Star Crunch get adopted,

476
0:13:15,520 --> 0:13:17,760
it was sad to see Dora Lee all by herself.

477
0:13:19,040 --> 0:13:20,320
Oh my god, she's actually sad.

478
0:13:20,320 --> 0:13:21,840
She's like, just realize what happened.

479
0:13:21,840 --> 0:13:23,120
And now we have one,

480
0:13:23,120 --> 0:13:25,120
and we're going to give whoever adopts Dora Lee over there

481
0:13:25,120 --> 0:13:27,120
an even bigger surprise than everyone else.

482
0:13:27,120 --> 0:13:28,640
And since she's the only dog left,

483
0:13:28,640 --> 0:13:29,840
she doesn't need a kennel.

484
0:13:29,840 --> 0:13:31,920
This entire building is her kennel.

485
0:13:31,920 --> 0:13:32,560
She's so fast.

486
0:13:33,360 --> 0:13:34,800
We made sure to give Dora Lee

487
0:13:34,800 --> 0:13:36,960
all the attention the last dog deserved,

488
0:13:36,960 --> 0:13:39,760
as we waited and waited and waited

489
0:13:39,760 --> 0:13:42,160
until finally one person walked in.

490
0:13:42,160 --> 0:13:43,200
How's it going, man?

491
0:13:43,200 --> 0:13:44,240
This is Dora Lee.

492
0:13:44,240 --> 0:13:44,800
Hey.

493
0:13:44,800 --> 0:13:45,360
Dora Lee.

494
0:13:45,360 --> 0:13:46,400
Oh, she seems to like you.

495
0:13:46,400 --> 0:13:47,280
She's a good kid, yeah.

496
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:49,600
She was saved after being abandoned

497
0:13:49,600 --> 0:13:50,880
during a hurricane in Dahlia,

498
0:13:50,880 --> 0:13:52,880
and now she's just looking for a forever home.

499
0:13:52,880 --> 0:13:54,240
I think she just found one.

500
0:13:54,240 --> 0:13:56,080
But before you can take Dora Lee home,

501
0:13:56,080 --> 0:13:58,320
one person has to approve of it.

502
0:13:58,320 --> 0:13:59,600
Maybe it's the interior.

503
0:13:59,600 --> 0:14:00,960
If no one takes her home, I'll take her.

504
0:14:01,600 --> 0:14:02,560
How's it going?

505
0:14:02,560 --> 0:14:04,560
I need you to give your blessing, okay?

506
0:14:04,560 --> 0:14:06,000
I feel like super happy.

507
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:06,560
Oh, yeah.

508
0:14:06,560 --> 0:14:07,280
Prove.

509
0:14:07,280 --> 0:14:08,640
We're going to give him the paperwork.

510
0:14:08,640 --> 0:14:09,360
Take care.

511
0:14:09,360 --> 0:14:10,000
Congratulations.

512
0:14:10,640 --> 0:14:12,320
Oh, I just hung up on Dave.

513
0:14:12,320 --> 0:14:14,320
He's way too big for you to do that.

514
0:14:14,320 --> 0:14:16,960
Congratulations on adopting Dora Lee.

515
0:14:16,960 --> 0:14:19,520
And as a reward for adopting the 100th dog,

516
0:14:19,520 --> 0:14:22,640
we have $20,000 in cash for you.

517
0:14:22,640 --> 0:14:23,520
Are you serious?

518
0:14:23,520 --> 0:14:24,800
You have to promise us.

519
0:14:24,800 --> 0:14:26,320
You will always take care of her.

520
0:14:26,320 --> 0:14:26,960
Right.

521
0:14:26,960 --> 0:14:28,960
I have one final surprise for the people

522
0:14:28,960 --> 0:14:30,720
that helped us get all these dogs adopted.

523
0:14:30,720 --> 0:14:31,360
Come on in.

524
0:14:33,600 --> 0:14:36,320
As a thank you for letting us use your place,

525
0:14:36,320 --> 0:14:39,040
we wanted to make a $100,000 donation.

526
0:14:39,040 --> 0:14:41,440
So you can keep finding abandoned dog homes.

527
0:14:41,440 --> 0:14:42,960
We also brought a bunch of money

528
0:14:42,960 --> 0:14:45,280
for all of you that helped us get them adopted.

529
0:14:45,280 --> 0:14:46,480
Thank you, Spot and Jinx,

530
0:14:46,480 --> 0:14:48,160
for providing pet insurance and dog food.

531
0:14:48,160 --> 0:14:49,200
That was wonderful.

532
0:14:49,200 --> 0:14:50,720
There's about 50 grand of those wool girls,

533
0:14:50,720 --> 0:14:52,400
which is extra on top of what they made

534
0:14:52,400 --> 0:14:53,440
when we paid them to help.

535
0:14:53,440 --> 0:14:54,640
Thank you for watching.
