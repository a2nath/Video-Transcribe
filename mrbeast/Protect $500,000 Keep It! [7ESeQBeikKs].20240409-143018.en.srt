1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:04,700
These five tanks are literally about to rain missiles upon this $500,000.

2
0:00:04,700 --> 0:00:07,500
And any money that doesn't get destroyed, I'm giving to Blake.

3
0:00:08,100 --> 0:00:10,500
But lucky for you, I'm gonna give you my credit card,

4
0:00:10,500 --> 0:00:13,500
and you can spend as much money as you want trying to protect this money

5
0:00:13,500 --> 0:00:16,000
from all the missiles we're gonna be launching at your money.

6
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:17,600
So I just build whatever I want.

7
0:00:17,600 --> 0:00:21,400
Whatever you want, but you only have 24 hours until we fire these tanks.

8
0:00:21,400 --> 0:00:22,700
I need metal, let's go!

9
0:00:22,700 --> 0:00:23,800
Alright, let's go boys!

10
0:00:23,800 --> 0:00:26,100
He's running, we're kicking this off with a sprint!

11
0:00:26,100 --> 0:00:27,800
Alright Blake, where we going to first?

12
0:00:27,800 --> 0:00:28,700
Sinking the junkyard.

13
0:00:28,700 --> 0:00:33,200
Blake's first three hours consisted of sourcing any metal he could find to protect his money.

14
0:00:33,200 --> 0:00:35,300
I mean, this looks like they have metal.

15
0:00:35,300 --> 0:00:37,900
Even if that meant spending $30,000.

16
0:00:37,900 --> 0:00:39,900
Definitely want that, want that, all the trucks.

17
0:00:39,900 --> 0:00:41,400
Basically, you just want every car here.

18
0:00:41,400 --> 0:00:41,900
Yeah.

19
0:00:41,900 --> 0:00:43,800
Can you give me any of your shipping containers?

20
0:00:43,800 --> 0:00:44,300
Gonna go back?

21
0:00:44,300 --> 0:00:45,600
Yeah, this is good.

22
0:00:45,600 --> 0:00:48,000
I feel like those will work well if I put them on top of the money.

23
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:50,700
And as if buying out the entire store wasn't enough,

24
0:00:50,700 --> 0:00:54,000
Blake did the same thing at two other industrial stores.

25
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,700
Everything I get from you today, I would need within the next 12 hours.

26
0:00:58,700 --> 0:01:00,700
I'm willing to pay double.

27
0:01:00,700 --> 0:01:01,600
Okay, we'll get it.

28
0:01:01,600 --> 0:01:03,700
He's very quick to throw my money around.

29
0:01:03,700 --> 0:01:05,100
$15,000.

30
0:01:05,100 --> 0:01:07,300
And while we waited for the materials to be delivered,

31
0:01:07,300 --> 0:01:10,600
we headed back to the money and Blake laid out his official plan.

32
0:01:10,600 --> 0:01:13,000
You just spent the last hour strategizing,

33
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,900
what did you come up with to stop the tanks from destroying your money?

34
0:01:15,900 --> 0:01:19,100
Step one, I want to put a shipping container over the mud.

35
0:01:19,100 --> 0:01:20,500
That is actually genius.

36
0:01:20,500 --> 0:01:22,400
Step two, giant water tank.

37
0:01:22,400 --> 0:01:23,500
Do you think that's your best defense?

38
0:01:23,500 --> 0:01:24,900
I think it's good, but it's not the best.

39
0:01:24,900 --> 0:01:28,300
Step three is containers filled with brick, hay, and wood.

40
0:01:28,300 --> 0:01:33,300
Step four is my best defense, a fortress of strategically angled cars.

41
0:01:33,300 --> 0:01:34,600
From the last video that I saw,

42
0:01:34,600 --> 0:01:37,500
those bullets are going to hit those cars in ricochet elsewhere.

43
0:01:37,500 --> 0:01:39,700
If he actually builds everything you see here,

44
0:01:39,700 --> 0:01:41,400
I will be flabbergasted.

45
0:01:41,400 --> 0:01:42,200
Let's get to work.

46
0:01:42,200 --> 0:01:42,600
Good luck.

47
0:01:42,600 --> 0:01:43,800
Unfortunately for Blake,

48
0:01:43,800 --> 0:01:47,300
it wouldn't be for another four hours until his materials were delivered.

49
0:01:47,300 --> 0:01:50,200
So he hired some construction workers to help get the job done.

50
0:01:50,200 --> 0:01:51,800
I'm building a complete fortress.

51
0:01:51,800 --> 0:01:53,300
You dropped the atomic bomb on this thing.

52
0:01:53,300 --> 0:01:54,400
The money's not going anywhere.

53
0:01:54,400 --> 0:01:57,000
This is like an industrial construction site.

54
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:00,600
It started to look like Blake might actually have a chance at protecting his money.

55
0:02:00,600 --> 0:02:03,300
But even if the 500 grand survives those tanks,

56
0:02:03,300 --> 0:02:08,000
the tanks are actually only the first of four phases of attacks Blake will have to defend.

57
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:09,500
And believe me when I say this,

58
0:02:09,500 --> 0:02:11,800
they're going to get much more challenging.

59
0:02:11,800 --> 0:02:12,800
For the rest of the night,

60
0:02:12,800 --> 0:02:15,500
Blake and his crew worked tirelessly to defend the money.

61
0:02:15,500 --> 0:02:17,200
But by the time the sun rose,

62
0:02:17,200 --> 0:02:18,800
they still weren't quite done.

63
0:02:18,800 --> 0:02:20,200
Looking good, looking good.

64
0:02:22,700 --> 0:02:23,600
That's the money.

65
0:02:23,600 --> 0:02:24,800
The tanks are over there.

66
0:02:24,800 --> 0:02:26,000
What is this car here for?

67
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:28,100
This is like my inventory back here, dude.

68
0:02:28,100 --> 0:02:30,300
Put your inventory between the money and the tank.

69
0:02:30,300 --> 0:02:32,000
Give me 10 minutes and that white car will be right there.

70
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:33,400
I mean, you have five minutes.

71
0:02:35,700 --> 0:02:37,800
I don't think I even have time to do anything else.

72
0:02:38,900 --> 0:02:39,900
Time is up.

73
0:02:39,900 --> 0:02:41,100
Stop, stop. Time is up.

74
0:02:41,100 --> 0:02:41,600
Drop it.

75
0:02:41,600 --> 0:02:42,600
Drop it right there.

76
0:02:42,600 --> 0:02:44,400
Go far away.

77
0:02:44,400 --> 0:02:46,500
Blake, time has officially ended.

78
0:02:49,200 --> 0:02:50,200
Seems pretty sturdy.

79
0:02:50,200 --> 0:02:51,600
Let's go fire some tanks.

80
0:02:51,600 --> 0:02:54,200
I've been up for about 25 hours now.

81
0:02:54,200 --> 0:02:55,500
Just building and building and building.

82
0:02:55,500 --> 0:02:57,100
I mean, I'm looking at it now and it looks great.

83
0:02:57,100 --> 0:02:59,700
But then I turn around and I see these five beasts.

84
0:02:59,700 --> 0:03:01,600
And then I see these shells that they're working with.

85
0:03:01,600 --> 0:03:03,400
I really had no idea they were going to be that big.

86
0:03:03,400 --> 0:03:05,400
You think a shipping container is stopping that?

87
0:03:05,400 --> 0:03:06,700
Hopefully three of them are.

88
0:03:06,700 --> 0:03:07,500
Oh, man.

89
0:03:07,500 --> 0:03:08,600
All right, it's time.

90
0:03:08,600 --> 0:03:10,000
Load up the tanks.

91
0:03:10,000 --> 0:03:11,600
All right, these five tanks,

92
0:03:11,600 --> 0:03:12,800
pointed at your money,

93
0:03:12,800 --> 0:03:14,800
are about to fire 20 rounds.

94
0:03:14,800 --> 0:03:16,300
Blake, fire the first shot.

95
0:03:20,000 --> 0:03:21,000
There's so much dust.

96
0:03:21,400 --> 0:03:22,600
Oh my gosh.

97
0:03:22,600 --> 0:03:23,800
Look at his face.

98
0:03:23,800 --> 0:03:24,900
Look at Blake's face.

99
0:03:24,900 --> 0:03:26,100
No way his money's safe.

100
0:03:26,100 --> 0:03:27,500
So only 19 more, right?

101
0:03:27,500 --> 0:03:28,800
19 more to go.

102
0:03:28,800 --> 0:03:30,100
Chandler, fire.

103
0:03:44,100 --> 0:03:45,600
This is way too much fun.

104
0:03:47,200 --> 0:03:48,400
Oh my God.

105
0:03:48,400 --> 0:03:49,700
All the way back here, I can count.

106
0:03:49,700 --> 0:03:51,000
Eight holes in that shipping container.

107
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:52,200
Yeah, I see those holes.

108
0:03:52,200 --> 0:03:53,400
No shot, his money's safe.

109
0:03:53,400 --> 0:03:54,700
I'd ask you how you're feeling.

110
0:03:54,700 --> 0:03:56,300
But we might as well fire the last few shots.

111
0:03:56,300 --> 0:03:57,400
Let's just get this over with.

112
0:03:57,400 --> 0:03:58,400
Five shots.

113
0:03:59,900 --> 0:04:01,200
Four shots remain.

114
0:04:03,400 --> 0:04:04,900
Three shots remain.

115
0:04:04,900 --> 0:04:06,200
How much money do you have back there?

116
0:04:06,200 --> 0:04:07,700
Uh, I feel like half.

117
0:04:09,100 --> 0:04:10,200
Two remain.

118
0:04:12,100 --> 0:04:13,100
And of course, Blake,

119
0:04:13,100 --> 0:04:14,800
you have to fire the last shell.

120
0:04:14,800 --> 0:04:15,600
The honor is mine.

121
0:04:15,600 --> 0:04:18,200
After this, we'll see if you have any money left.

122
0:04:19,800 --> 0:04:20,800
Let's go.

123
0:04:20,800 --> 0:04:21,700
Oh, he's running.

124
0:04:21,700 --> 0:04:22,700
He's so fast.

125
0:04:22,700 --> 0:04:24,100
Is there any money?

126
0:04:24,100 --> 0:04:25,900
Hey, it's still there.

127
0:04:25,900 --> 0:04:27,400
Yes!

128
0:04:27,400 --> 0:04:28,800
Blake, it looked like your money's survived.

129
0:04:28,800 --> 0:04:30,000
We got a fresh stack.

130
0:04:30,000 --> 0:04:30,800
I know you're happy,

131
0:04:30,800 --> 0:04:33,000
but we're going to move on to phase two of four.

132
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And in 24 hours,

133
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:35,700
we're going to blow up the biggest bomb

134
0:04:35,700 --> 0:04:36,800
we've ever detonated

135
0:04:36,800 --> 0:04:39,000
in the history of our channel around your money.

136
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:40,000
Are you going to drop it?

137
0:04:40,000 --> 0:04:40,900
Are you going to shoot it?

138
0:04:40,900 --> 0:04:41,700
I'm glad you asked.

139
0:04:41,700 --> 0:04:42,800
I'll be right back.

140
0:04:42,800 --> 0:04:44,800
Blake, what do you think's in those green crates?

141
0:04:44,800 --> 0:04:45,600
I don't know, dude.

142
0:04:45,600 --> 0:04:46,200
It looks like...

143
0:04:46,200 --> 0:04:47,100
Here, I'll answer for you.

144
0:04:47,100 --> 0:04:51,100
This is a hundred crates filled to the brim with TNT.

145
0:04:51,100 --> 0:04:52,400
How are you even allowed to do that?

146
0:04:52,400 --> 0:04:53,600
I'm not sure it's legal.

147
0:04:53,600 --> 0:04:56,100
And while we prepared one of the biggest explosions

148
0:04:56,100 --> 0:04:57,600
in YouTube history,

149
0:04:57,600 --> 0:05:00,400
Blake began to strategize on how to keep his money safe.

150
0:05:00,400 --> 0:05:03,800
Step one, we got to take everything flammable out of here, man.

151
0:05:03,800 --> 0:05:05,100
All the wood has got to go.

152
0:05:05,100 --> 0:05:07,000
Step two, water tanks.

153
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,300
Step three, I want to move the shipping containers that I got.

154
0:05:09,300 --> 0:05:11,700
I just want to close them in into the other shipping containers.

155
0:05:11,700 --> 0:05:13,400
And then step four is just walls,

156
0:05:13,400 --> 0:05:15,600
cements, bricks, cars if I have to.

157
0:05:15,600 --> 0:05:17,600
Explosion is a lot worse than the tanks.

158
0:05:17,600 --> 0:05:19,600
This is bigger than that safe that blew up.

159
0:05:21,800 --> 0:05:22,300
Yes.

160
0:05:22,300 --> 0:05:25,800
Every single thing inside of that destroyed.

161
0:05:25,800 --> 0:05:28,800
The first time he lost $250,000 in this video,

162
0:05:28,800 --> 0:05:31,800
we're going to repeat it.

163
0:05:31,800 --> 0:05:32,200
No.

164
0:05:32,200 --> 0:05:33,300
And because at this point,

165
0:05:33,300 --> 0:05:35,700
Blake had been awake for over 24 hours.

166
0:05:35,700 --> 0:05:38,100
He trusted the construction workers to finish the job

167
0:05:38,100 --> 0:05:39,700
while he got a good night's rest.

168
0:05:39,700 --> 0:05:40,600
Yeah, I'm going to bed.

169
0:05:40,600 --> 0:05:41,300
Get out, guys.

170
0:05:41,300 --> 0:05:42,900
This is Blake going darting.

171
0:05:42,900 --> 0:05:44,500
And because he was so exhausted,

172
0:05:44,500 --> 0:05:46,800
Blake slept for way longer than he planned.

173
0:05:46,800 --> 0:05:48,300
All right, I got a good night's sleep.

174
0:05:48,300 --> 0:05:49,800
I'm about to find out how much progress

175
0:05:49,800 --> 0:05:51,400
was really done overnight.

176
0:05:51,400 --> 0:05:52,400
Like half.

177
0:05:54,400 --> 0:05:55,400
Empty.

178
0:05:55,400 --> 0:05:58,900
That means nothing has happened since I've been gone.

179
0:05:58,900 --> 0:06:00,600
And with only six hours remaining,

180
0:06:00,600 --> 0:06:02,900
Blake did what he could by covering his weak spots

181
0:06:02,900 --> 0:06:06,000
with spare parts, bricks, and more cars.

182
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:06,700
Looking good in here.

183
0:06:06,700 --> 0:06:07,800
Looking real good.

184
0:06:12,900 --> 0:06:14,000
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.

185
0:06:14,100 --> 0:06:15,400
What am I about to witness?

186
0:06:15,400 --> 0:06:17,100
If you listen closely, you can hear beeping.

187
0:06:17,100 --> 0:06:18,600
It's actually a school bus coming,

188
0:06:18,600 --> 0:06:20,800
and it's going to be plopped right where you're standing.

189
0:06:20,800 --> 0:06:22,500
I assume it's not full of children.

190
0:06:22,500 --> 0:06:24,100
It's a short bus.

191
0:06:24,100 --> 0:06:25,400
That is just not what I asked.

192
0:06:25,400 --> 0:06:27,400
This is our brand new Peacefuls board.

193
0:06:27,400 --> 0:06:28,500
New flavor, new branding.

194
0:06:28,500 --> 0:06:29,300
You want to try, Blake?

195
0:06:29,300 --> 0:06:30,900
Yeah.

196
0:06:30,900 --> 0:06:32,900
I'm using our snack products to distract them

197
0:06:32,900 --> 0:06:34,100
from telling them where to put the bus.

198
0:06:34,100 --> 0:06:35,400
Dude, honestly,

199
0:06:35,400 --> 0:06:37,200
this is better than all the other ones.

200
0:06:37,200 --> 0:06:38,200
All the other ones.

201
0:06:38,200 --> 0:06:38,900
I promise.

202
0:06:38,900 --> 0:06:41,400
Anyone want a piece of chocolate?

203
0:06:41,400 --> 0:06:42,700
Oh.

204
0:06:43,700 --> 0:06:44,800
Did you just get that?

205
0:06:47,300 --> 0:06:49,600
Hey, Blake, five minutes till boom.

206
0:06:49,600 --> 0:06:50,600
I need 10 more minutes.

207
0:06:50,600 --> 0:06:51,900
Just give me five extra minutes.

208
0:06:51,900 --> 0:06:53,100
You have four minutes.

209
0:06:53,100 --> 0:06:54,900
Bro, you're spraying them with water.

210
0:06:54,900 --> 0:06:56,200
Probably feels good.

211
0:06:56,200 --> 0:06:57,300
I don't think they agree.

212
0:06:57,300 --> 0:06:59,000
They're literally getting off the car.

213
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:00,900
They've got 90 seconds left.

214
0:07:00,900 --> 0:07:03,100
Blake, you're running out of time.

215
0:07:03,100 --> 0:07:05,900
Go, go, come on, come on.

216
0:07:05,900 --> 0:07:07,400
Hey, it's five o'clock.

217
0:07:07,400 --> 0:07:09,100
Stop, stop, stop.

218
0:07:09,100 --> 0:07:10,500
Turn it off, turn it off.

219
0:07:10,500 --> 0:07:12,100
Hey, hey, Blake.

220
0:07:12,100 --> 0:07:14,100
Turn it off or I start taking money.

221
0:07:14,100 --> 0:07:15,100
Ugh.

222
0:07:15,100 --> 0:07:16,500
Let's go over to the bunker.

223
0:07:16,500 --> 0:07:18,700
You narrowly escaped death from the tanks.

224
0:07:18,700 --> 0:07:20,200
Let's see if you can do it again.

225
0:07:20,200 --> 0:07:22,800
Let the sun go down so it's a little darker now.

226
0:07:22,800 --> 0:07:26,300
This is the biggest bomb we've ever set off.

227
0:07:26,300 --> 0:07:28,600
Yeah, this is the first bomb I've ever seen.

228
0:07:28,600 --> 0:07:29,800
Blake, are you nervous?

229
0:07:29,800 --> 0:07:31,400
Yeah, I'm sweating now.

230
0:07:31,400 --> 0:07:32,600
This is the detonation device.

231
0:07:32,600 --> 0:07:33,400
Here you go.

232
0:07:33,400 --> 0:07:34,200
It's live?

233
0:07:34,200 --> 0:07:35,000
Yes, it's live.

234
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Two days of work, 17 cars,

235
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:39,300
six water jugs,

236
0:07:39,300 --> 0:07:40,700
four shipping containers,

237
0:07:40,700 --> 0:07:43,200
$500,000 on the line.

238
0:07:43,200 --> 0:07:46,600
Let's find out if you're going home rich or with nothing.

239
0:07:46,600 --> 0:07:47,900
When you're ready, Blake.

240
0:07:47,900 --> 0:07:52,500
Three, two, one.

241
0:07:52,500 --> 0:07:53,200
Mom, I love you.

242
0:08:06,200 --> 0:08:07,300
Oh my gosh.

243
0:08:07,300 --> 0:08:09,600
That mire storm is massive.

244
0:08:09,600 --> 0:08:10,400
Can we go put that out?

245
0:08:10,400 --> 0:08:12,800
Before we go put it out, I'm just wasting time.

246
0:08:12,800 --> 0:08:13,300
Run!

247
0:08:13,300 --> 0:08:14,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

248
0:08:14,200 --> 0:08:15,200
The fire station, go.

249
0:08:15,200 --> 0:08:16,600
Go, go, go.

250
0:08:16,600 --> 0:08:17,700
Let's go see if it burns.

251
0:08:17,700 --> 0:08:19,800
Oh no.

252
0:08:19,800 --> 0:08:21,800
Oh, it's on fire over there.

253
0:08:21,800 --> 0:08:23,200
No.

254
0:08:23,200 --> 0:08:27,000
Oh, be careful of this.

255
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:28,800
Ah!

256
0:08:28,800 --> 0:08:29,800
Get off my money.

257
0:08:29,800 --> 0:08:31,300
The fire's still going on up front.

258
0:08:31,300 --> 0:08:33,600
Blake is moving sandbags.

259
0:08:33,600 --> 0:08:34,800
Please don't be ashes.

260
0:08:34,800 --> 0:08:36,400
Please don't be ashes.

261
0:08:36,400 --> 0:08:36,800
What do you see?

262
0:08:36,800 --> 0:08:37,800
What do you see?

263
0:08:37,800 --> 0:08:39,400
I see green!

264
0:08:39,400 --> 0:08:40,200
Oh my gosh.

265
0:08:40,200 --> 0:08:41,600
Yeah, baby!

266
0:08:41,600 --> 0:08:42,400
Yeah!

267
0:08:42,400 --> 0:08:45,600
I see a lot of dirt on it, but it seems to survive.

268
0:08:45,600 --> 0:08:46,600
Whoa!

269
0:08:46,600 --> 0:08:47,400
I knew it.

270
0:08:47,400 --> 0:08:50,300
Blake, you've officially passed phase two of four.

271
0:08:50,300 --> 0:08:52,700
Do you want to see what the next challenge is?

272
0:08:52,700 --> 0:08:53,200
Yes.

273
0:08:59,200 --> 0:09:01,200
All right, Blake, for your third challenge,

274
0:09:01,200 --> 0:09:04,600
we're going to be dropping flaming cars filled with gasoline

275
0:09:04,600 --> 0:09:05,600
on top of your money.

276
0:09:05,600 --> 0:09:06,800
Can you tell me how many cars?

277
0:09:06,800 --> 0:09:07,300
A lot.

278
0:09:07,300 --> 0:09:08,200
A lot?

279
0:09:08,200 --> 0:09:10,100
A lot.

280
0:09:10,700 --> 0:09:13,800
This is going to be the hardest phase yet.

281
0:09:13,800 --> 0:09:17,000
Blake will not only have to deflect the attack from the sky,

282
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:20,500
but he'll also have to protect his money from the flammable gasoline

283
0:09:20,500 --> 0:09:22,500
seeping through the cracks of his defense.

284
0:09:22,500 --> 0:09:26,100
And after we drop the cars, I have another surprise.

285
0:09:26,100 --> 0:09:26,800
Good luck.

286
0:09:26,800 --> 0:09:30,500
I want the crate with the money in it to be stuffed with concrete.

287
0:09:30,500 --> 0:09:33,900
That shipping container that's just sitting plopped that on top of the money.

288
0:09:33,900 --> 0:09:37,000
Since Blake had been working so hard for the past few days,

289
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:40,500
he ended up going right to sleep and saved most of his work for the next day.

290
0:09:40,500 --> 0:09:42,100
And although he seemed confident,

291
0:09:42,100 --> 0:09:44,800
this challenge would soon prove itself to be more difficult

292
0:09:44,800 --> 0:09:47,200
than anything he's ever faced in these videos.

293
0:09:51,200 --> 0:09:52,500
Hi, this is day four.

294
0:09:52,500 --> 0:09:53,800
I'm feeling like a zombie.

295
0:09:53,800 --> 0:09:56,200
We're going to take the other shipping container that I have.

296
0:09:56,200 --> 0:09:59,500
We're going to pick that up and we're going to put it in a formation

297
0:09:59,500 --> 0:10:02,300
to where the point is facing up so it's like a pyramid.

298
0:10:02,300 --> 0:10:05,400
The cars will hit it, doom and fall, but not on the money.

299
0:10:05,500 --> 0:10:08,400
We've got to get that shipping container on top as soon as possible.

300
0:10:08,400 --> 0:10:09,600
You're starting to worry me a little bit.

301
0:10:09,600 --> 0:10:10,800
Over the next few hours,

302
0:10:10,800 --> 0:10:14,200
Blake did everything in his power to place the top shipping container

303
0:10:14,200 --> 0:10:16,000
at an angle to deflect the cars,

304
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:18,800
even if that meant using wooden logs to prop it up.

305
0:10:18,800 --> 0:10:22,300
If this container does not go exactly where I want to right now,

306
0:10:22,300 --> 0:10:25,000
I'm probably losing a lot of money.

307
0:10:26,400 --> 0:10:27,200
We did it.

308
0:10:27,200 --> 0:10:28,800
Oh, that makes me feel really good.

309
0:10:28,800 --> 0:10:31,300
The water tank, we bring that over to like right here,

310
0:10:31,300 --> 0:10:32,700
fill that thing with bricks,

311
0:10:32,700 --> 0:10:34,900
and then we're going to take the last car we got,

312
0:10:34,900 --> 0:10:36,000
put it right here.

313
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:37,100
That's going to block all this.

314
0:10:37,100 --> 0:10:38,100
It's going to look great.

315
0:10:38,100 --> 0:10:39,500
We got a plan, baby.

316
0:10:39,500 --> 0:10:42,800
But what Blake didn't know is I was about to introduce a twist.

317
0:10:42,800 --> 0:10:44,200
Do you want to know what the twist is?

318
0:10:44,200 --> 0:10:44,800
Yeah.

319
0:10:44,800 --> 0:10:45,500
Follow me.

320
0:10:45,500 --> 0:10:46,700
See that flag over there?

321
0:10:46,700 --> 0:10:47,800
That's a catapult.

322
0:10:47,800 --> 0:10:49,500
So as cars fall from the top,

323
0:10:49,500 --> 0:10:51,900
giant flaming balls are going to be hurled from the side.

324
0:10:51,900 --> 0:10:53,900
Dude, I've been guessing millions of things

325
0:10:53,900 --> 0:10:55,200
I never thought catapult.

326
0:10:55,200 --> 0:10:56,600
I have like no more materials.

327
0:10:56,600 --> 0:10:57,700
I have nothing else to use.

328
0:10:57,700 --> 0:10:58,900
Throughout the final hour,

329
0:10:58,900 --> 0:11:01,800
Blake raced to cover the weak spots of his fortress.

330
0:11:01,800 --> 0:11:04,100
However, there was still a key part missing.

331
0:11:04,100 --> 0:11:06,700
His water truck, which he sent to refill in the morning,

332
0:11:06,700 --> 0:11:07,900
was painfully laid.

333
0:11:07,900 --> 0:11:09,400
He has 90 seconds left.

334
0:11:09,400 --> 0:11:10,300
All right, here we go.

335
0:11:10,300 --> 0:11:18,100
As always, it comes down to the wire with like 60, 59, 58, 54.

336
0:11:18,100 --> 0:11:21,000
He's drenching everything in water before we drop the cars

337
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:22,900
to try to protect his money from the fire.

338
0:11:22,900 --> 0:11:24,300
30 seconds remain.

339
0:11:24,300 --> 0:11:26,600
You really think this is going to stop the fire?

340
0:11:26,600 --> 0:11:27,700
Oh yeah, baby.

341
0:11:27,700 --> 0:11:32,400
Three, two, one, drop it.

342
0:11:32,400 --> 0:11:35,000
Just for that, I'm not showing mercy on the last one.

343
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:35,500
You knew that was going to happen, dude.

344
0:11:35,500 --> 0:11:37,100
That was intentional.

345
0:11:37,100 --> 0:11:38,500
Oh man, moment of truth.

346
0:11:38,500 --> 0:11:40,200
Look how high up that bad boy is.

347
0:11:40,200 --> 0:11:42,900
This is only the first of five flaming cars

348
0:11:42,900 --> 0:11:43,900
we're going to be dropping

349
0:11:43,900 --> 0:11:47,100
on top of the five flaming death balls from the catapult.

350
0:11:47,100 --> 0:11:47,700
You ready, Blake?

351
0:11:47,700 --> 0:11:48,800
Get this going, dude.

352
0:11:48,800 --> 0:11:53,400
Light it on fire!

353
0:11:53,400 --> 0:11:54,300
Now drop it.

354
0:11:54,300 --> 0:11:55,300
Oh no.

355
0:11:55,300 --> 0:11:59,100
Oh my god!

356
0:11:59,100 --> 0:12:01,100
Hold on, everything's actually setting on fire right now.

357
0:12:01,100 --> 0:12:03,800
The burning cars successfully rolled off the container.

358
0:12:03,800 --> 0:12:06,200
However, the wood that Blake used to prop it up

359
0:12:06,200 --> 0:12:07,700
quickly engulfed in flames.

360
0:12:07,700 --> 0:12:10,300
Dude, what's going on?

361
0:12:10,300 --> 0:12:12,400
What is happening?

362
0:12:12,400 --> 0:12:14,000
What in there is on fire, Blake?

363
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:15,800
I don't, I don't even know what to say.

364
0:12:15,800 --> 0:12:18,000
What was on top of the shipping container?

365
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:19,400
All right, there is wood there.

366
0:12:19,400 --> 0:12:20,700
Well, it's not a jinx it.

367
0:12:20,700 --> 0:12:21,400
Knock on wood.

368
0:12:21,400 --> 0:12:22,800
You put wood?

369
0:12:22,800 --> 0:12:24,900
And you knew we were dropping flaming cars?

370
0:12:24,900 --> 0:12:26,400
I needed to use them, dude.

371
0:12:26,400 --> 0:12:29,400
Luckily, Blake did surround his money with cinder blocks.

372
0:12:29,400 --> 0:12:33,500
So there's still a very high likelihood his money is unburned.

373
0:12:33,500 --> 0:12:36,200
And since we're about to go into the coolest part of this video,

374
0:12:36,200 --> 0:12:39,300
obviously now, I'm going to tell you about Acorns.

375
0:12:39,300 --> 0:12:41,800
Their debit card is meant to help you grow your money,

376
0:12:41,800 --> 0:12:44,600
not just spend it, which I'll tell you more about in a second.

377
0:12:44,600 --> 0:12:49,900
Fire!

378
0:12:49,900 --> 0:12:52,000
Acorns just launched the new Mighty Oak debit card

379
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:53,600
that they made with Dwayne Johnson.

380
0:12:53,600 --> 0:12:56,400
Cool thing about this debit card is every time you make a purchase,

381
0:12:56,400 --> 0:12:58,400
it automatically rounds up to the nearest dollar

382
0:12:58,400 --> 0:12:59,800
and invests the difference for you.

383
0:12:59,800 --> 0:13:02,600
Believe it or not, your money is also under attack.

384
0:13:02,600 --> 0:13:04,300
Not by giant flaming death balls,

385
0:13:04,300 --> 0:13:07,400
but by things like bills, spending, and inflation.

386
0:13:07,400 --> 0:13:08,500
And when you're not spending,

387
0:13:08,500 --> 0:13:09,800
your money will be hard at work

388
0:13:09,800 --> 0:13:12,400
into the highest APYs available.

389
0:13:12,400 --> 0:13:16,100
Chandler, what does APYs mean?

390
0:13:16,100 --> 0:13:18,800
It means you can fight back against bills and inflation

391
0:13:18,800 --> 0:13:19,900
by growing your money,

392
0:13:19,900 --> 0:13:21,800
just by having your money in your account.

393
0:13:21,800 --> 0:13:23,400
Blake, how you doing, buddy?

394
0:13:23,400 --> 0:13:26,600
I'm remembering what it feels like to lose one of these things.

395
0:13:26,600 --> 0:13:27,700
Whoa!

396
0:13:27,700 --> 0:13:29,100
Oh, it's a direct hit.

397
0:13:29,100 --> 0:13:30,100
Oh, right on the money!

398
0:13:30,100 --> 0:13:31,300
And just from signing up,

399
0:13:31,300 --> 0:13:34,700
Acorns and I are giving you $20 to start growing your money.

400
0:13:34,700 --> 0:13:37,100
So go to acorns.com slash Mr. Beast

401
0:13:37,100 --> 0:13:40,000
to learn how you can make your money work for you.

402
0:13:40,000 --> 0:13:42,800
Light it on fire!

403
0:13:42,800 --> 0:13:48,200
Drop it!

404
0:13:48,200 --> 0:13:53,000
The rain of fire continued all throughout the night.

405
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And as the flames only grew bigger,

406
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,400
things sadly started to look really bleak

407
0:13:57,400 --> 0:13:58,300
for Blake's money.

408
0:13:58,300 --> 0:13:59,800
No, no, no.

409
0:13:59,800 --> 0:14:02,300
That fire was raging for over an hour and a half.

410
0:14:02,300 --> 0:14:03,700
It's either all going to be there

411
0:14:03,700 --> 0:14:05,300
or it's not going to be there at all.

412
0:14:05,300 --> 0:14:07,300
That right there is a bunch of logs of wood.

413
0:14:07,300 --> 0:14:10,200
He accidentally created a giant bonfire.

414
0:14:10,200 --> 0:14:11,500
He thought he was making a fortress,

415
0:14:11,500 --> 0:14:13,200
but he was actually making a furnace.

416
0:14:13,200 --> 0:14:14,500
I mean, there's still a chance

417
0:14:14,500 --> 0:14:16,300
the concrete protected the money.

418
0:14:16,300 --> 0:14:18,000
Blake, moment of truth.

419
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:21,300
Did the cinder blocks protect your money?

420
0:14:21,300 --> 0:14:23,300
Or was the fire just too much?

421
0:14:23,300 --> 0:14:25,400
Oh, my God.

422
0:14:25,400 --> 0:14:26,900
Oh, no.

423
0:14:26,900 --> 0:14:29,000
Oh.

424
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:30,800
Oh, those are ruined.

425
0:14:30,800 --> 0:14:32,100
Wait, hold up.

426
0:14:32,100 --> 0:14:35,700
The money is fried.

427
0:14:35,700 --> 0:14:37,600
It's a thousand degrees in there.

428
0:14:37,600 --> 0:14:40,500
Let's be real with ourselves, Blake.

429
0:14:40,500 --> 0:14:43,700
It's gone.

430
0:14:43,700 --> 0:14:47,100
As you saw, most of the money looks like this.

431
0:14:47,100 --> 0:14:48,500
Another loss.

432
0:14:48,500 --> 0:14:50,800
Yeah, this one hurts more than the laser one.

433
0:14:50,800 --> 0:14:53,700
What hurts the most is that it works so hard

434
0:14:53,700 --> 0:14:55,800
for nothing.

435
0:14:55,900 --> 0:14:57,000
Yeah, it sucks.

436
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:00,700
The challenge is officially over.

437
0:15:00,700 --> 0:15:02,100
And before you go, Blake,

438
0:15:02,100 --> 0:15:03,300
I have an offer for you.

439
0:15:03,300 --> 0:15:04,700
You have two choices.

440
0:15:04,700 --> 0:15:07,500
You can either walk away with $100,000

441
0:15:07,500 --> 0:15:10,000
or you can get a third and final chance

442
0:15:10,000 --> 0:15:11,600
to compete in a future video.

443
0:15:15,100 --> 0:15:16,100
All right, I'm coming back.

444
0:15:16,100 --> 0:15:16,900
You're coming back?

445
0:15:16,900 --> 0:15:17,700
I'm coming back.

446
0:15:17,700 --> 0:15:18,400
Okay.

447
0:15:18,400 --> 0:15:20,400
Blake's final chance to be in a video

448
0:15:20,400 --> 0:15:21,700
is going to be right here,

449
0:15:21,700 --> 0:15:24,200
but it won't be uploaded until February.

450
0:15:24,200 --> 0:15:26,200
I don't think me, the audience, everyone

451
0:15:26,200 --> 0:15:27,900
can bear to see you lose a third time.

452
0:15:27,900 --> 0:15:28,900
I'll see you then.
