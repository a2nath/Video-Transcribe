0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:04,000
My friend, Mac, is about to experience this scariest moment in his life.

2
0:00:04,000 --> 0:00:06,000
I'm just gonna let you know. I'm not afraid of anything.

3
0:00:06,000 --> 0:00:07,000
We'll see.

4
0:00:07,000 --> 0:00:08,000
You cannot scare me.

5
0:00:08,000 --> 0:00:09,000
Seal them up!

6
0:00:09,000 --> 0:00:13,000
You have to survive 10 minutes with a thousand spiders to move up.

7
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Release the spiders!

8
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Start the timer!

9
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The reason we're doing this is because Mac said no matter how hard I try, I can't scare him.

10
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Would you say you're scared now?

11
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I like getting there a little bit.

12
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
A little bit?

13
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And this is only one of many fears Mac will face in this video.

14
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:40,000
And if he can successfully face all of the fears, he will win $800,000.

15
0:00:40,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I'm not gonna lie. This was way more gnarly than I thought it would be.

16
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Three, two, one. Lift it up, lift it up.

17
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Congratulations on passing the first challenge! Let's go!

18
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But Mac has to finish all of these fears if he wants to win that $800,000 prize.

19
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:00,000
I know you're blindfolded, but trust me, just walk up this ramp.

20
0:01:00,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Raise us up!

21
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
What are you taking of me?

22
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Stand up, stand up.

23
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:08,000
You're fine, you're fine.

24
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:10,000
No, no, no, no.

25
0:01:10,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Okay, you can hold on to it.

26
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:12,000
That's cute.

27
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Mac, take off your blindfold.

28
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:20,000
Welcome to challenge number two.

29
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The next fear is the fear of heights.

30
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You're gonna stand on the end of that plank.

31
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Unclip this so you'll be connected to nothing.

32
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Press that button and then free fall 200 feet.

33
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And without knowing how, trust I'll catch you.

34
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
No, no, no.

35
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:38,000
You're shaking.

36
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Yeah, of course I'm shaking.

37
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I'm gonna fall off of this without a harness on?

38
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Yeah.

39
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I can't even see the ground.

40
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Oh, be very careful.

41
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Mac, I'm just gonna tell you, even though you can't see the ground, you are very, very high up.

42
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Oh my God, Mac!

43
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
All you have to do is unclip it and press that button.

44
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I want you to look at me in the eyes right now.

45
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:00,000
Yeah.

46
0:02:00,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And tell me that I'm gonna fall and something's gonna catch me.

47
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Something will break your fall.

48
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I promise.

49
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Oh my...

50
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You're literally attached to nothing.

51
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Oh my God.

52
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:10,000
The clip is gone.

53
0:02:10,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Oh my God, dude.

54
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
You don't have to do it.

55
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:19,000
If you want to, you can tap out and just admit that you are wrong and you do get scared.

56
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:23,000
No way.

57
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
God, dude.

58
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I would have to say you look pretty scared.

59
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Oh my God.

60
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

61
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:43,000
God speed.

62
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:44,000
God speed.

63
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Zero.

64
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Oh!

65
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Let's go!

66
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:00,000
I can't believe you did it.

67
0:03:00,000 --> 0:03:01,000
He's a psycho.

68
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And if you're wondering who my psychotic friend, Matt, is, he's actually a contestant from a previous challenge video.

69
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And sadly, he ended up losing $800,000.

70
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But now he is on challenge three of six to attempt to win that money back.

71
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Here we are.

72
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Yeah.

73
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The next challenge.

74
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Why don't you get a $5 car?

75
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Put the end of the grand inside of it?

76
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
As you can see, this car is pointed towards the lake.

77
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I'm guessing you're going to want me to drive the car into the lake?

78
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:29,000
No.

79
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:30,000
That would be dangerous.

80
0:03:30,000 --> 0:03:32,000
As you can see, there's no gas pedal.

81
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Obviously, you can't drive it in the lake.

82
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Yeah, I'm so stupid.

83
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Why would I think that I could drive it into the lake?

84
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Yeah, stupid, yeah.

85
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:40,000
Which is why we're going to drop him in the lake.

86
0:03:40,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Bring in the crane!

87
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Oh, oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

88
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Oh, it is getting real now.

89
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Okay.

90
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Oh my God.

91
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:50,000
Oh my God.

92
0:03:50,000 --> 0:03:52,000
All right, Mac, listen up and listen good.

93
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Once we drop you in this lake, the car will quickly begin to sink.

94
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And in the backseat is the 800 grand you've been competing for,

95
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
divvied up into eight double bags.

96
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
However many bags you can save from this sinking car

97
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
determines how much money you'll continue competing for in this video.

98
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And whatever you leave behind is gone forever.

99
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Oh my gosh, dude!

100
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I will never tell you that I'm scared.

101
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But I'm about as close as you can be right now

102
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to the feeling I can tell.

103
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:20,000
Before we drop your car, I'm going to give you a one-off.

104
0:04:20,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If you play it right now.

105
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And admit I scared you.

106
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I'll give you $100,000.

107
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And we call it even.

108
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:30,000
Yeah, all right.

109
0:04:30,000 --> 0:04:31,000
He's not going to take it.

110
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:32,000
There's not a god!

111
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I knew that was going to happen.

112
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Hey, no, take that.

113
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I knew he was going to do that.

114
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I lost it all last time.

115
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It's not happening again.

116
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Three, two, one.

117
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Oh my God.

118
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Drop him!

119
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Oh!

120
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Oh!

121
0:04:50,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Hey, Mac!

122
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
You've got about 20 seconds to break out of that car

123
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
before it sinks under the water!

124
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Back!

125
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The car's going under!

126
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Hurry up!

127
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Come on!

128
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Oh, God!

129
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Oh!

130
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:29,000
That car is gone.

131
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
That sunk so fast.

132
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Oh my God.

133
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Wow!

134
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
He's alive!

135
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Come back!

136
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:36,000
No!

137
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Go grab that back room!

138
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:38,000
All right.

139
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Somebody grab this!

140
0:05:40,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The scariest part about this challenge

141
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
is every second the car sinks deeper into the water,

142
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
making it harder to get to and harder to see.

143
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So if Mac wants to keep all of his prize money,

144
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:54,000
he really needs to be moving as fast as possible.

145
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But as you can see, that's not going to be easy.

146
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Come here!

147
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Take it!

148
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Mac continued saving back.

149
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Oh my God.

150
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
After bag, after bag.

151
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Mac, you are crazy.

152
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But on top of the fact that the car is sinking deeper and deeper,

153
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
what Mac hasn't realized yet

154
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is that the last two bags of money

155
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:28,000
are actually seat-belted into the back seat of the car.

156
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:30,000
Dude, Mac could be an action movie, honestly.

157
0:06:30,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Well, he was like a borderline Olympic swimmer

158
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:33,000
earlier in his life,

159
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
which is why it did this fear.

160
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Wait, but it's like 40 feet down

161
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and the water is freezing cold.

162
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:40,000
How can he hold his breath that long?

163
0:06:40,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Oh.

164
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Oh.

165
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Oh.

166
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Oh.

167
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Oh.

168
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Oh.

169
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Oh.

170
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Oh.

171
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Oh.

172
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:50,000
Oh.

173
0:06:50,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Oh.

174
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Oh.

175
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Oh.

176
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Oh.

177
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Oh.

178
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Oh.

179
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Oh.

180
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Oh.

181
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:00,000
Ah.

182
0:07:00,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Oh, we got another bag.

183
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We're you got 700 grand on the boat.

184
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Just stop now.

185
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:05,000
No, no.

186
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Just stop now.

187
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Just leave it on the bottom of the lake.

188
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We can do the next.

189
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:09,000
No!

190
0:07:10,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Alright, he doesn't care.

191
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:12,000
At this point,

192
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the car was literally at the bottom

193
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
of this 45-foot deep lake,

194
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
making it almost impossible for Mac

195
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:20,000
to retrieve the last $100,000.

196
0:07:20,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Well, it cannot.

197
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's black down there.

198
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:24,000
There's nothing.

199
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Are you officially calling it?

200
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I can't see the car.

201
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:27,280
It's gone, yeah.

202
0:07:27,280 --> 0:07:28,360
Oh, the boat's tilting.

203
0:07:28,360 --> 0:07:29,840
Wow, you are very athletic.

204
0:07:29,840 --> 0:07:32,600
Do you like this video better or the other video better?

205
0:07:32,600 --> 0:07:35,400
Dude, this video is like 10 times as intense.

206
0:07:35,400 --> 0:07:36,220
I know.

207
0:07:36,220 --> 0:07:37,440
And even though this looked very crazy,

208
0:07:37,440 --> 0:07:39,920
there's actually seven safety divers on standby

209
0:07:39,920 --> 0:07:41,400
to make sure Mac didn't die.

210
0:07:41,400 --> 0:07:43,280
Your prize is now 700 grand.

211
0:07:43,280 --> 0:07:45,680
But from here on out, it's all or nothing.

212
0:07:45,680 --> 0:07:47,920
Mac has to face the three remaining fears

213
0:07:47,920 --> 0:07:50,360
to walk out of this with his 700 grand.

214
0:07:50,360 --> 0:07:51,760
This one might be the hardest one.

215
0:07:51,760 --> 0:07:52,960
Ah, okay.

216
0:07:52,960 --> 0:07:54,040
Is it grossed in spiders?

217
0:07:54,040 --> 0:07:54,880
Just come on in.

218
0:07:54,920 --> 0:07:57,160
Inside this room is a metal box.

219
0:07:57,160 --> 0:08:00,080
In order to progress, you'll need to reach inside the box

220
0:08:00,080 --> 0:08:01,480
and pull out what's inside.

221
0:08:01,480 --> 0:08:02,840
Before you put your hand in the box,

222
0:08:02,840 --> 0:08:03,960
we're gonna need you to sign this.

223
0:08:03,960 --> 0:08:05,880
It just basically says that you can't sue me

224
0:08:05,880 --> 0:08:07,280
if anything in there hurts you.

225
0:08:07,280 --> 0:08:08,320
Huh.

226
0:08:08,320 --> 0:08:09,600
Just sign right there.

227
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:12,640
All right, we got it signed.

228
0:08:12,640 --> 0:08:14,120
What is it, like an animal or something?

229
0:08:14,120 --> 0:08:17,320
There are things in this box.

230
0:08:17,320 --> 0:08:18,240
Just step up here.

231
0:08:18,240 --> 0:08:19,720
You put your hand in one of these holes.

232
0:08:19,720 --> 0:08:20,560
Okay.

233
0:08:20,560 --> 0:08:22,320
And there's a thing in here you need to pull out.

234
0:08:22,320 --> 0:08:24,800
Oh, dude, that is freaky as, uh, okay.

235
0:08:24,800 --> 0:08:26,160
I'm just gonna make sure it's moving.

236
0:08:26,160 --> 0:08:27,000
Stop.

237
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:27,840
Okay, go for it.

238
0:08:27,840 --> 0:08:28,680
Ah!

239
0:08:28,680 --> 0:08:30,160
It clearly has not touched him yet.

240
0:08:30,160 --> 0:08:32,160
No matter what, once you grab onto it,

241
0:08:32,160 --> 0:08:33,360
you have to pull it out.

242
0:08:41,800 --> 0:08:45,640
What you grab is our grand new Festival Wars.

243
0:08:45,640 --> 0:08:49,400
We got all new branding and a better tasting formula.

244
0:08:49,400 --> 0:08:50,240
Let's try it together.

245
0:08:50,240 --> 0:08:51,480
I am not gonna go soft on you.

246
0:08:51,480 --> 0:08:53,280
I'm gonna tell you honestly what I think.

247
0:08:54,280 --> 0:08:55,720
Okay, that's pretty good.

248
0:08:55,720 --> 0:08:58,440
The new formula is milkier, creamier.

249
0:08:58,440 --> 0:08:59,960
We have our all new crunch flavor,

250
0:08:59,960 --> 0:09:01,960
the milk chocolate flavor, almond flavor,

251
0:09:01,960 --> 0:09:03,720
my personal favorite, and peanut butter.

252
0:09:03,720 --> 0:09:06,280
These new and improved Festival Wars are rolling out now.

253
0:09:06,280 --> 0:09:07,920
Give us a couple of days to get them on the shelves

254
0:09:07,920 --> 0:09:09,840
in your local Walmart Target 7-Eleven

255
0:09:09,840 --> 0:09:12,080
and I cannot wait to see what you think of them.

256
0:09:12,080 --> 0:09:13,760
All right, Mac, you ready for the next fear?

257
0:09:13,760 --> 0:09:15,600
Jimmy, I've been in this exact same room

258
0:09:15,600 --> 0:09:17,320
and I've had a bunch of money on the line before.

259
0:09:17,320 --> 0:09:18,160
Yep.

260
0:09:18,160 --> 0:09:21,000
I'll tell you what, if you give me 500 grand right now,

261
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:21,840
I'll walk.

262
0:09:21,840 --> 0:09:23,480
Do you guys hear this, man?

263
0:09:23,480 --> 0:09:24,320
Jimmy.

264
0:09:24,320 --> 0:09:25,400
Who asked for 500 grand?

265
0:09:25,400 --> 0:09:26,240
400 grand.

266
0:09:26,240 --> 0:09:27,080
No.

267
0:09:27,080 --> 0:09:27,920
Hear me out.

268
0:09:27,920 --> 0:09:30,360
If you said 200, maybe 250, I would have considered it.

269
0:09:30,360 --> 0:09:32,040
All right, how about 350?

270
0:09:32,040 --> 0:09:33,560
No.

271
0:09:33,560 --> 0:09:34,400
All right, let's go.

272
0:09:34,400 --> 0:09:35,480
Next challenge.

273
0:09:35,480 --> 0:09:36,680
I knew he'd break.

274
0:09:36,680 --> 0:09:37,920
All right, I might have lied.

275
0:09:37,920 --> 0:09:39,440
That one wasn't actually that hard,

276
0:09:39,440 --> 0:09:41,320
but this next one is actually based

277
0:09:41,320 --> 0:09:43,280
on one of the scariest things I've ever done.

278
0:09:43,280 --> 0:09:44,360
Oh, there's no way.

279
0:09:45,360 --> 0:09:47,000
No, about quickly he pieced it together.

280
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:48,840
No, no, no, no, there is actually no way.

281
0:09:48,840 --> 0:09:49,680
Come on.

282
0:09:49,680 --> 0:09:50,960
There is actually no way, Jimmy.

283
0:09:50,960 --> 0:09:52,320
Is it that obvious what it is?

284
0:09:52,320 --> 0:09:53,160
We'll give it away.

285
0:09:53,160 --> 0:09:55,000
The tombstone with your name?

286
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:56,040
Oh, Jesus.

287
0:09:56,040 --> 0:09:57,320
For the next challenge,

288
0:09:57,320 --> 0:10:00,680
we are going to bury you alive for 24 hours.

289
0:10:00,680 --> 0:10:03,520
Ah, no way, dude.

290
0:10:03,520 --> 0:10:05,160
And you can get out whatever you want,

291
0:10:05,160 --> 0:10:07,040
but you don't know what time it is,

292
0:10:07,040 --> 0:10:09,160
and if you leave before the 24 hour mark,

293
0:10:09,160 --> 0:10:10,400
you lose everything.

294
0:10:10,400 --> 0:10:11,800
It's a good fear.

295
0:10:11,800 --> 0:10:12,880
Yes.

296
0:10:12,880 --> 0:10:14,880
For once, I'm on the other side.

297
0:10:14,880 --> 0:10:15,920
Yeah, bro.

298
0:10:15,920 --> 0:10:17,120
Oh my gosh.

299
0:10:17,120 --> 0:10:18,720
It might get a little cold.

300
0:10:18,720 --> 0:10:20,440
Oh, no, and don't mess it up.

301
0:10:20,440 --> 0:10:22,080
I'm sorry, not to.

302
0:10:22,080 --> 0:10:23,720
This is from my nightmares, man.

303
0:10:23,720 --> 0:10:25,800
It feels wrong being on the other side of this,

304
0:10:25,800 --> 0:10:27,520
but also fun.

305
0:10:27,520 --> 0:10:29,120
Oh, what the?

306
0:10:29,120 --> 0:10:30,680
Oh, this is so freaky.

307
0:10:32,600 --> 0:10:34,640
The funny thing is that the timer hasn't even started yet,

308
0:10:34,640 --> 0:10:35,640
because you aren't fully buried.

309
0:10:35,640 --> 0:10:37,080
It feels wrong saying this,

310
0:10:37,080 --> 0:10:39,480
but can you bury me faster?

311
0:10:39,480 --> 0:10:40,480
As you wish, Mac.

312
0:10:40,480 --> 0:10:42,400
Bring in the extra hand.

313
0:10:42,400 --> 0:10:44,280
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

314
0:10:44,280 --> 0:10:46,120
Ah!

315
0:10:46,120 --> 0:10:48,760
Let's officially start the timer.

316
0:10:48,760 --> 0:10:50,880
It looks like 24 hours just started,

317
0:10:50,880 --> 0:10:52,320
and I'm already freaked,

318
0:10:52,320 --> 0:10:53,600
so this ain't gonna be good.

319
0:10:53,600 --> 0:10:55,080
Mac, see that rope above your head?

320
0:10:55,080 --> 0:10:56,200
Can you pull it from me real quick?

321
0:10:56,200 --> 0:10:57,040
Is this a trick?

322
0:10:57,040 --> 0:10:57,880
No.

323
0:10:59,080 --> 0:11:00,480
Next time you pull that bell,

324
0:11:00,480 --> 0:11:01,600
we will dig you up,

325
0:11:01,600 --> 0:11:04,040
and if it does not say above 24 hours,

326
0:11:04,040 --> 0:11:05,200
you lose everything.

327
0:11:05,200 --> 0:11:06,680
I will burn your house down.

328
0:11:07,960 --> 0:11:09,800
And also the $700,000.

329
0:11:09,800 --> 0:11:11,520
Yeah, I was like, everything?

330
0:11:11,520 --> 0:11:12,360
Everything.

331
0:11:12,360 --> 0:11:13,360
Sweet dreams, Mac,

332
0:11:13,360 --> 0:11:15,120
and don't throw the walking talk.

333
0:11:15,120 --> 0:11:17,280
Oh, was it that predictable?

334
0:11:17,280 --> 0:11:18,640
I already know they threw it,

335
0:11:18,640 --> 0:11:19,800
but I'm not even up there.

336
0:11:19,800 --> 0:11:21,680
It's so much more fun to be on this side of it.

337
0:11:21,680 --> 0:11:24,120
And to make sure Mac doesn't die in his own grave,

338
0:11:24,120 --> 0:11:25,480
he's gonna be wearing this wristband

339
0:11:25,480 --> 0:11:27,960
that directly tells us his heart rate and vitals,

340
0:11:27,960 --> 0:11:29,240
and no, it does not give him

341
0:11:29,240 --> 0:11:30,840
any way of knowing what time it is.

342
0:11:30,840 --> 0:11:32,080
Basically, I need to figure out

343
0:11:32,080 --> 0:11:33,120
how to keep track of the time.

344
0:11:33,120 --> 0:11:34,080
So here's my strategy.

345
0:11:34,080 --> 0:11:36,720
I could try to stay awake for two hours,

346
0:11:36,720 --> 0:11:39,000
sleep for 10 hours,

347
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:41,440
and then I would be halfway done with the challenge,

348
0:11:41,440 --> 0:11:42,880
and I could just do that twice,

349
0:11:42,880 --> 0:11:43,840
and that would be good.

350
0:11:43,840 --> 0:11:45,360
With Mac's plan now in place,

351
0:11:45,360 --> 0:11:47,080
his first step was to pass the time

352
0:11:47,080 --> 0:11:48,200
for the next two hours.

353
0:11:48,200 --> 0:11:49,280
Well, it's no feasible bar,

354
0:11:49,280 --> 0:11:51,360
but I guess it makes hunger stop.

355
0:11:51,360 --> 0:11:54,040
But it was pretty obvious he was quickly getting bored.

356
0:11:54,040 --> 0:11:57,800
Mm-hmm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

357
0:11:57,800 --> 0:11:58,640
You're gonna be honest,

358
0:11:58,640 --> 0:12:00,760
not much going on inside this room.

359
0:12:00,760 --> 0:12:02,280
That's the whole point.

360
0:12:02,280 --> 0:12:03,840
And Mac being bored this early

361
0:12:03,840 --> 0:12:05,280
is a pretty telltale sign

362
0:12:05,280 --> 0:12:07,280
that he may not be too good at this,

363
0:12:07,280 --> 0:12:09,280
because already within 45 minutes,

364
0:12:09,280 --> 0:12:12,560
Mac's idea of time was horrendously off.

365
0:12:12,560 --> 0:12:14,360
I think it's been about two hours.

366
0:12:14,360 --> 0:12:16,720
I've been trying to get about 10 hours of sleep,

367
0:12:16,720 --> 0:12:19,000
which should put me at the halfway mark.

368
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:20,520
Even though the pro to sleeping

369
0:12:20,520 --> 0:12:22,640
is it will help Mac pass the time faster,

370
0:12:22,640 --> 0:12:24,400
first night sleeping in the coffin.

371
0:12:24,400 --> 0:12:26,440
The con is it's very difficult for him

372
0:12:26,440 --> 0:12:28,720
to keep track of how long he's been buried,

373
0:12:28,720 --> 0:12:31,000
especially when he's not even able to stay asleep

374
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:32,880
for more than 30 minutes at a time.

375
0:12:32,880 --> 0:12:35,840
I have no idea what time it is right now.

376
0:12:35,840 --> 0:12:37,120
And a little creeped out.

377
0:12:37,120 --> 0:12:38,320
Mm-hmm.

378
0:12:38,320 --> 0:12:40,000
I'm hoping for the love of God.

379
0:12:40,000 --> 0:12:42,080
It's been over 12 hours.

380
0:12:42,080 --> 0:12:43,760
I think that's where we're at.

381
0:12:43,760 --> 0:12:45,280
And because when I did this challenge,

382
0:12:45,280 --> 0:12:48,120
I was constantly woken up by my friends.

383
0:12:48,120 --> 0:12:49,960
Jimmy Jam!

384
0:12:49,960 --> 0:12:52,560
I thought I'd give Mac the same joyful experience.

385
0:12:52,560 --> 0:12:54,640
Wake up, Mac! Are you okay?

386
0:12:54,640 --> 0:12:55,560
Whoa!

387
0:12:55,560 --> 0:12:57,840
Dude, you look like you just got hit by a truck.

388
0:12:57,840 --> 0:12:59,960
It kind of feels like I did just get hit by a truck.

389
0:12:59,960 --> 0:13:02,080
If I was to legitimately guess how many hours in I am,

390
0:13:02,080 --> 0:13:03,360
I think it's like...

391
0:13:05,520 --> 0:13:07,320
The longer Mac stayed in the coffin,

392
0:13:07,320 --> 0:13:09,720
the less he seemed to know what time it was.

393
0:13:11,680 --> 0:13:15,040
Might be an hour 16.

394
0:13:15,040 --> 0:13:17,880
And because we like to build a lot of suspense on this channel,

395
0:13:17,880 --> 0:13:19,440
for the remainder of this fear,

396
0:13:19,440 --> 0:13:21,880
you're not going to know how long he's been in there either.

397
0:13:23,880 --> 0:13:25,720
And even though Mac wanted to ensure

398
0:13:25,720 --> 0:13:27,680
that he was going to be there long enough,

399
0:13:27,680 --> 0:13:30,120
it was clear the claustrophobia was getting to him.

400
0:13:30,120 --> 0:13:33,040
Being in this coffin is scary.

401
0:13:33,040 --> 0:13:33,880
Like...

402
0:13:35,200 --> 0:13:36,280
That?

403
0:13:36,280 --> 0:13:39,080
And the longer I'm in here, the worse I feel.

404
0:13:39,080 --> 0:13:40,480
It's a crazy feeling.

405
0:13:40,480 --> 0:13:43,080
But eventually, when we saw Mac begin to grab that rope,

406
0:13:43,080 --> 0:13:45,480
we knew he was thinking about ringing that bell.

407
0:13:45,480 --> 0:13:47,560
That's the face of somebody that's about to ring this bell soon.

408
0:13:47,560 --> 0:13:49,760
There's no way it's been out for 24 hours.

409
0:13:51,200 --> 0:13:52,920
God, I'm nervous.

410
0:13:52,920 --> 0:13:54,880
I've been in one of these videos before,

411
0:13:54,880 --> 0:13:56,160
and I've lost everything.

412
0:13:56,160 --> 0:13:58,520
And the only reason I even came back here at all

413
0:13:58,520 --> 0:14:01,520
and got a second chance is actually because of you guys.

414
0:14:01,520 --> 0:14:04,480
Me screwing up that second chance all comes down

415
0:14:04,480 --> 0:14:08,160
to if I know for a fact it's been 24 hours.

416
0:14:08,160 --> 0:14:11,080
I really hope I'm not making a mistake right now.

417
0:14:11,120 --> 0:14:14,040
Mac's buddy, pal.

418
0:14:14,040 --> 0:14:14,880
How you doing?

419
0:14:16,280 --> 0:14:18,400
Jimmy, I'm pretty nervous.

420
0:14:18,400 --> 0:14:21,440
I don't want to accidentally reveal the time, so no comment.

421
0:14:21,440 --> 0:14:23,280
Jimmy, I don't know how you did this for seven days, dude.

422
0:14:23,280 --> 0:14:24,920
I do not feel well in here.

423
0:14:24,920 --> 0:14:26,760
Yeah, have you got to a point where you start

424
0:14:26,760 --> 0:14:28,240
to lose blood flow in your leg?

425
0:14:28,240 --> 0:14:31,360
Then you feel like your back is gonna fall out of your body?

426
0:14:32,480 --> 0:14:34,320
Jimmy, I'm thinking about pulling this thing.

427
0:14:34,320 --> 0:14:35,160
No comment.

428
0:14:35,160 --> 0:14:36,640
Jimmy, I'll give you 50 bucks back

429
0:14:36,640 --> 0:14:37,680
if you tell me what time it is.

430
0:14:37,680 --> 0:14:38,520
No comment.

431
0:14:39,320 --> 0:14:40,440
All right, well, I got a comment for you.

432
0:14:40,440 --> 0:14:42,360
You just get a shot already, all right?

433
0:14:42,360 --> 0:14:45,120
Three, oh my gosh, he's about to do it.

434
0:14:45,120 --> 0:14:47,360
Two, this is it.

435
0:14:48,560 --> 0:14:50,280
One.

436
0:14:50,280 --> 0:14:51,120
Oh!

437
0:14:51,120 --> 0:14:52,600
Stop the timer!

438
0:14:52,600 --> 0:14:55,080
And now that Mac has made his decision,

439
0:14:55,080 --> 0:14:57,720
there was just one last thing I had to do.

440
0:14:57,720 --> 0:14:59,280
Do you mind if I tell them about Shopify

441
0:14:59,280 --> 0:15:00,520
while we unbury you?

442
0:15:00,520 --> 0:15:01,640
You have got to be kidding me.

443
0:15:01,640 --> 0:15:03,800
Shopify is a platform that helps entrepreneurs

444
0:15:03,800 --> 0:15:05,200
get started down the path they want.

445
0:15:05,200 --> 0:15:07,400
Sometimes starting a business can be scary,

446
0:15:07,400 --> 0:15:08,760
like getting covered in spiders

447
0:15:08,760 --> 0:15:09,800
or being buried alive.

448
0:15:09,800 --> 0:15:11,760
I can tell you, you do not wanna be buried alive.

449
0:15:11,760 --> 0:15:12,960
But Shopify is here to help.

450
0:15:12,960 --> 0:15:14,280
If I hadn't started my own business,

451
0:15:14,280 --> 0:15:16,320
I wouldn't have been able to go to all the crazy places

452
0:15:16,320 --> 0:15:18,880
like Antarctica and make videos like these for you guys.

453
0:15:18,880 --> 0:15:20,400
And just like millions of other people

454
0:15:20,400 --> 0:15:21,440
have done with Shopify,

455
0:15:21,440 --> 0:15:24,360
you can get started today on your business right now.

456
0:15:24,360 --> 0:15:26,240
Mac, do you wanna know how long you're in there?

457
0:15:26,240 --> 0:15:27,400
I'm feeling you're not gonna tell me

458
0:15:27,400 --> 0:15:28,480
until you dig me up.

459
0:15:28,480 --> 0:15:29,360
You are correct.

460
0:15:29,360 --> 0:15:31,360
And one of the perks of owning my own business

461
0:15:31,360 --> 0:15:32,480
is I can do fun things

462
0:15:32,480 --> 0:15:34,240
like send one of my friends to the Super Bowl.

463
0:15:34,240 --> 0:15:35,440
Mac, Carl and Nolan,

464
0:15:35,440 --> 0:15:37,480
each have their very own football for sale.

465
0:15:37,480 --> 0:15:39,440
And whoever's football sells the most,

466
0:15:39,440 --> 0:15:41,280
I'm gonna give you tickets to the Super Bowl.

467
0:15:41,280 --> 0:15:43,240
And I'm gonna bury the other one alive.

468
0:15:43,240 --> 0:15:45,200
All that matters is that you download the Shop App

469
0:15:45,200 --> 0:15:46,040
and vote for one of them

470
0:15:46,040 --> 0:15:48,320
by buying either Nolan's or Carl's football.

471
0:15:48,320 --> 0:15:50,040
And now that I can afford this video,

472
0:15:50,040 --> 0:15:53,440
let's see if Mac loses $700,000.

473
0:15:53,440 --> 0:15:54,680
Hi.

474
0:15:54,680 --> 0:15:55,520
Hey, Jimmy.

475
0:15:56,560 --> 0:15:57,400
There you go.

476
0:15:57,400 --> 0:15:58,720
Welcome to the outside world.

477
0:15:58,720 --> 0:16:00,280
Now that you are out of the coffin,

478
0:16:00,280 --> 0:16:02,440
let's see if you are in there for 24 hours.

479
0:16:02,440 --> 0:16:05,120
If the number I reveal is lower than 24 hours,

480
0:16:05,120 --> 0:16:06,760
then you lose $700,000.

481
0:16:06,760 --> 0:16:09,000
Ah, I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

482
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:12,480
Three, two, one.

483
0:16:14,560 --> 0:16:15,880
36 hours.

484
0:16:17,200 --> 0:16:19,560
That's the one I am talking about.

485
0:16:22,040 --> 0:16:22,960
He scares me.

486
0:16:22,960 --> 0:16:24,240
Congratulations, Mac.

487
0:16:24,240 --> 0:16:27,040
This means that you are now just one challenge away

488
0:16:27,040 --> 0:16:28,280
from winning all this money.

489
0:16:28,280 --> 0:16:29,120
Let's go.

490
0:16:29,120 --> 0:16:30,440
You should probably go shower first.

491
0:16:30,440 --> 0:16:32,280
Yeah, I smell not great.

492
0:16:32,280 --> 0:16:33,440
So far in this video,

493
0:16:33,440 --> 0:16:36,200
Mac has shown me it is very difficult to scare him.

494
0:16:36,200 --> 0:16:38,120
But the final challenge of this video

495
0:16:38,160 --> 0:16:40,160
may just be Mac's worst fear ever.

496
0:16:40,160 --> 0:16:43,560
And that's because the final challenge of this video

497
0:16:43,560 --> 0:16:46,000
is a one-to-one recreation

498
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:47,840
of the challenge he failed on last time.

499
0:16:47,840 --> 0:16:49,080
The last challenge.

500
0:16:49,080 --> 0:16:50,000
Hope this is in front of your face.

501
0:16:50,000 --> 0:16:50,840
Don't look.

502
0:16:50,840 --> 0:16:51,680
Okay, I'm not looking.

503
0:16:51,680 --> 0:16:52,520
Don't look.

504
0:16:52,520 --> 0:16:53,360
I'm not looking.

505
0:16:53,360 --> 0:16:54,200
All right, keep your eyes closed.

506
0:16:54,200 --> 0:16:55,040
Don't open them.

507
0:16:55,040 --> 0:16:55,960
Don't open your eyes.

508
0:16:55,960 --> 0:16:56,800
Keep walking.

509
0:16:56,800 --> 0:16:57,640
Don't open them.

510
0:16:57,640 --> 0:16:59,000
Don't open them.

511
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:00,120
All right.

512
0:17:00,120 --> 0:17:00,960
Open them.

513
0:17:02,400 --> 0:17:03,240
No!

514
0:17:03,240 --> 0:17:04,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

515
0:17:04,280 --> 0:17:05,400
I'm not doing that again, dude.

516
0:17:05,400 --> 0:17:06,240
I'm over here.

517
0:17:06,240 --> 0:17:07,080
No!

518
0:17:07,080 --> 0:17:07,920
Jimmy!

519
0:17:07,920 --> 0:17:09,000
I do not want to do this again.

520
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:09,840
It's in here.

521
0:17:09,840 --> 0:17:11,240
No, the cameras can see you.

522
0:17:11,240 --> 0:17:12,400
Okay.

523
0:17:12,400 --> 0:17:15,520
The last challenge is the fear of failure.

524
0:17:15,520 --> 0:17:20,480
We recreated the set where he lost $800,000 in this video.

525
0:17:20,480 --> 0:17:23,200
And like last time, the rules are extremely simple.

526
0:17:23,200 --> 0:17:24,440
There are four stages.

527
0:17:24,440 --> 0:17:26,440
Each has its own cookie with this shape on it.

528
0:17:26,440 --> 0:17:27,880
You have to cut out all the shapes

529
0:17:27,880 --> 0:17:29,240
without breaking a cookie.

530
0:17:29,240 --> 0:17:30,640
And if you do break a cookie,

531
0:17:30,640 --> 0:17:32,840
you lose $700,000.

532
0:17:32,840 --> 0:17:34,160
And for you specifically,

533
0:17:34,160 --> 0:17:36,720
it will have been the second time it's happened.

534
0:17:36,720 --> 0:17:38,160
This is from my nightmares, man.

535
0:17:38,160 --> 0:17:39,400
I do not want to be here again.

536
0:17:39,400 --> 0:17:41,200
Well, good, because I have an offer for you.

537
0:17:41,200 --> 0:17:42,800
You can quit right now

538
0:17:42,800 --> 0:17:44,680
and walk away with this 300 grand

539
0:17:44,680 --> 0:17:46,600
or risk it for the biscuit.

540
0:17:46,600 --> 0:17:48,480
And if you finish this final challenge,

541
0:17:48,480 --> 0:17:50,520
win $700,000.

542
0:17:51,880 --> 0:17:54,640
This is actually like a very, very big decision.

543
0:17:55,520 --> 0:17:57,040
Yeah, because that's not quite enough, is it?

544
0:17:57,040 --> 0:17:58,200
It's less than half.

545
0:17:58,200 --> 0:17:59,920
But if you lose again,

546
0:17:59,920 --> 0:18:03,520
that is $1.5 million lost on this set.

547
0:18:04,640 --> 0:18:05,480
Are you sure?

548
0:18:06,400 --> 0:18:07,320
He's hitting him.

549
0:18:07,320 --> 0:18:08,800
Mac, I know this is hard,

550
0:18:08,800 --> 0:18:10,840
but you're going to have to make a decision here.

551
0:18:10,840 --> 0:18:13,840
Do you want to go home with $300,000?

552
0:18:13,840 --> 0:18:16,360
Or do you want to risk it all for this final challenge?

553
0:18:18,160 --> 0:18:19,280
All right, fine, I'm doing it.

554
0:18:19,280 --> 0:18:20,640
All right, to be honest, I'm glad.

555
0:18:20,640 --> 0:18:21,880
I want you to win this whole thing.

556
0:18:21,880 --> 0:18:23,280
If you look at this iPad right here,

557
0:18:23,280 --> 0:18:25,760
this is exactly how long it took Mac

558
0:18:25,760 --> 0:18:27,440
to get through all four stages

559
0:18:27,440 --> 0:18:28,920
last time he did the challenge.

560
0:18:28,920 --> 0:18:30,600
34 minutes and 54 seconds.

561
0:18:30,600 --> 0:18:33,720
So that's exactly how long I'm going to give you again.

562
0:18:34,720 --> 0:18:36,640
Starting now.

563
0:18:38,960 --> 0:18:41,280
Don't break the cookie while opening it.

564
0:18:41,280 --> 0:18:42,120
There you go.

565
0:18:44,960 --> 0:18:46,440
Even though he's going quick right now,

566
0:18:46,440 --> 0:18:47,720
it might not be in his best interest

567
0:18:47,720 --> 0:18:50,800
because if he accidentally snaps a cookie, he loses.

568
0:18:50,800 --> 0:18:51,960
34 minutes.

569
0:18:55,640 --> 0:18:57,040
Oh, wow, you did that quick?

570
0:18:59,160 --> 0:19:00,600
Scan, scan, scan, scan!

571
0:19:02,600 --> 0:19:03,440
It's great.

572
0:19:04,720 --> 0:19:06,680
This is a much different deal than last time.

573
0:19:06,680 --> 0:19:09,120
I'm going to take my sweet time cutting the circle out.

574
0:19:09,120 --> 0:19:10,120
Look out!

575
0:19:11,800 --> 0:19:13,240
He is flying through this.

576
0:19:16,640 --> 0:19:18,280
Why is it so much harder to open?

577
0:19:18,280 --> 0:19:20,560
Probably because you're like freaking out.

578
0:19:20,560 --> 0:19:21,840
Do you want me to try it?

579
0:19:21,840 --> 0:19:22,480
Open it.

580
0:19:22,480 --> 0:19:23,480
OK, hold my iPad.

581
0:19:27,560 --> 0:19:28,880
OK, it's very hard to open.

582
0:19:28,880 --> 0:19:29,840
What are you guys doing?

583
0:19:29,840 --> 0:19:31,640
I don't want to be responsible for that.

584
0:19:34,080 --> 0:19:35,080
Be careful.

585
0:19:36,240 --> 0:19:38,200
Theoretically, a Mac strategy makes sense.

586
0:19:38,200 --> 0:19:39,800
Getting through the easier shapes fast

587
0:19:39,800 --> 0:19:41,200
to save all the time for umbrella,

588
0:19:41,200 --> 0:19:42,760
which he lost 800 grand on.

589
0:19:42,760 --> 0:19:45,120
You literally still have 32 minutes left.

590
0:19:45,120 --> 0:19:46,480
Yeah, well, I'm going to need all 32 of those

591
0:19:46,480 --> 0:19:47,320
for umbrella.

592
0:19:47,320 --> 0:19:48,880
That is borderline impossible.

593
0:19:50,160 --> 0:19:51,000
Move out.

594
0:19:51,000 --> 0:19:52,720
Oh, I'm moving.

595
0:19:52,720 --> 0:19:53,560
Open it.

596
0:19:54,480 --> 0:19:55,320
Allow me.

597
0:19:55,320 --> 0:19:56,160
Oh.

598
0:19:57,440 --> 0:19:59,320
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, let's go!

599
0:20:04,480 --> 0:20:06,360
Mac, stop breaking my set.

600
0:20:06,360 --> 0:20:08,560
Bro, you guys got to make these easier to open.

601
0:20:09,840 --> 0:20:10,880
There's just no need to rush.

602
0:20:10,880 --> 0:20:12,480
You're literally using no time.

603
0:20:12,480 --> 0:20:14,240
I mean, you might need to go slower in this one

604
0:20:14,240 --> 0:20:15,920
because it's a lot trickier.

605
0:20:15,920 --> 0:20:17,720
This one's pretty hard.

606
0:20:17,720 --> 0:20:19,440
Not even close to umbrella.

607
0:20:19,440 --> 0:20:21,640
Trying to get to the race before I start racing.

608
0:20:23,720 --> 0:20:25,240
God, this is so hard.

609
0:20:34,720 --> 0:20:35,720
Oh my gosh.

610
0:20:40,720 --> 0:20:42,720
Well, I don't need that anymore.

611
0:20:42,720 --> 0:20:43,720
I, uh...

612
0:20:45,720 --> 0:20:46,720
Um...

613
0:20:49,720 --> 0:20:51,720
And maybe it didn't break all the way through?

614
0:20:51,720 --> 0:20:52,720
Ooh.

615
0:20:52,720 --> 0:20:53,720
Okay.

616
0:20:53,720 --> 0:20:54,720
Um...

617
0:20:54,720 --> 0:20:56,720
He still had 29 minutes left.

618
0:20:56,720 --> 0:20:58,720
He did the first two in four minutes.

619
0:21:00,720 --> 0:21:02,720
Oh, I did this.

620
0:21:03,720 --> 0:21:04,720
Oh my God.

621
0:21:04,720 --> 0:21:06,720
I did that twice?

622
0:21:06,720 --> 0:21:07,720
Here.

623
0:21:07,720 --> 0:21:08,720
Give me your hand.

624
0:21:08,720 --> 0:21:09,720
No, Jimmy, please.

625
0:21:09,720 --> 0:21:11,720
I don't want to leave yet.

626
0:21:11,720 --> 0:21:12,720
No, Jimmy.

627
0:21:12,720 --> 0:21:13,720
Give me your hand.

628
0:21:13,720 --> 0:21:14,720
No, dude.

629
0:21:14,720 --> 0:21:15,720
I don't even know how to feel right now.

630
0:21:15,720 --> 0:21:16,720
Like...

631
0:21:18,720 --> 0:21:19,720
Come on.

632
0:21:21,720 --> 0:21:23,720
I had so much time.

633
0:21:23,720 --> 0:21:24,720
Yeah.

634
0:21:24,720 --> 0:21:27,720
I'm still just not sure why you were going so fast.

635
0:21:27,720 --> 0:21:28,720
The umbrella.

636
0:21:28,720 --> 0:21:30,720
I just know that umbrella takes forever.

637
0:21:30,720 --> 0:21:31,720
Yeah.

638
0:21:33,720 --> 0:21:34,720
Okay.

639
0:21:34,720 --> 0:21:38,720
Mack told me in this video that there was nothing I could do to scare him.

640
0:21:38,720 --> 0:21:42,720
And after putting him through spiders, a sinking car, and more,

641
0:21:42,720 --> 0:21:44,720
I really did start to believe him.

642
0:21:44,720 --> 0:21:45,720
Godspeed.

643
0:21:45,720 --> 0:21:48,720
The only thing that ended up getting to Mack

644
0:21:48,720 --> 0:21:51,720
was the fear of his own failure.

645
0:21:52,720 --> 0:21:53,720
Godspeed.

646
0:22:02,720 --> 0:22:03,720
Godspeed.
