1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:05,000
We just got dropped off in the middle of an abandoned city and we're going to spend the next seven days here!

2
0:00:05,000 --> 0:00:06,600
And there goes our only way out!

3
0:00:06,600 --> 0:00:08,800
We are now stranded for the next seven days!

4
0:00:10,800 --> 0:00:11,800
Are we doing this?

5
0:00:12,200 --> 0:00:12,900
For content!

6
0:00:12,900 --> 0:00:16,800
This once beautiful city was bombed and abandoned because of war,

7
0:00:16,800 --> 0:00:21,200
which means the only people here are us and our cameraman, at least that we know of.

8
0:00:21,200 --> 0:00:23,400
So I guess we start off by getting off the roof?

9
0:00:23,400 --> 0:00:26,500
But we knew that our first objective was to explore this city

10
0:00:26,500 --> 0:00:29,700
and find a safe place to call home for the next seven days,

11
0:00:29,700 --> 0:00:31,800
which starts with exploring this building.

12
0:00:31,800 --> 0:00:34,300
Alright, let's see what's down the bottom of this building.

13
0:00:34,300 --> 0:00:36,800
I assume under this wood is a floor.

14
0:00:36,800 --> 0:00:38,400
Only one way to find out!

15
0:00:38,400 --> 0:00:40,700
Alright, this is crazy.

16
0:00:40,700 --> 0:00:42,600
I feel like I'm in a zombie apocalypse.

17
0:00:42,600 --> 0:00:43,600
This is wild!

18
0:00:43,600 --> 0:00:44,700
Oh, look at this!

19
0:00:44,700 --> 0:00:46,000
And after a little more exploring,

20
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,800
we stumbled across an area that might work for our shelter.

21
0:00:48,800 --> 0:00:49,900
Oh my gosh.

22
0:00:49,900 --> 0:00:51,800
I think this is where we should set up camp.

23
0:00:51,800 --> 0:00:54,500
You can see the entire city over here.

24
0:00:54,500 --> 0:00:56,500
Plus, we have a roof to protect us from rain.

25
0:00:56,500 --> 0:00:57,700
Wow!

26
0:00:57,700 --> 0:00:59,500
And now that we had our home base decided,

27
0:00:59,500 --> 0:01:01,700
the next step was to open up the supply crate

28
0:01:01,700 --> 0:01:03,500
left by the helicopter on the roof.

29
0:01:03,500 --> 0:01:05,400
Let's pop open this crate so we can build camp.

30
0:01:05,400 --> 0:01:06,900
We need some gear.

31
0:01:06,900 --> 0:01:08,700
Oh, wow!

32
0:01:08,700 --> 0:01:12,200
This crate contains all the survival gear we'll need for the next seven days.

33
0:01:12,200 --> 0:01:14,500
And so we don't have to carry stuff all the way down the stairs.

34
0:01:14,500 --> 0:01:15,700
We're just going to drop it.

35
0:01:15,700 --> 0:01:16,900
Oh.

36
0:01:18,900 --> 0:01:20,900
Chandler!

37
0:01:20,900 --> 0:01:22,600
We have a perfect assembly line!

38
0:01:22,600 --> 0:01:24,500
Chris, it's raining sleeping bag.

39
0:01:26,400 --> 0:01:28,700
Chandler, there's our dinner plate!

40
0:01:29,100 --> 0:01:30,400
Chandler, don't let it fall!

41
0:01:30,400 --> 0:01:31,500
Chandler!

42
0:01:31,500 --> 0:01:33,300
Yeah!

43
0:01:33,300 --> 0:01:35,700
That was the coolest thing we've ever done!

44
0:01:35,700 --> 0:01:39,000
But jokes aside, it was time to actually start surviving now.

45
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:40,300
Who wants fire duty?

46
0:01:40,300 --> 0:01:40,800
We'll get it.

47
0:01:40,800 --> 0:01:41,800
We're on bed duty.

48
0:01:41,800 --> 0:01:43,900
Chris got started on making a fire with Mark.

49
0:01:43,900 --> 0:01:46,800
I'm personally a fan of the log cabin when it comes to fires.

50
0:01:46,800 --> 0:01:47,500
Eagle Scout.

51
0:01:47,500 --> 0:01:48,900
Did I mention that yet?

52
0:01:50,100 --> 0:01:52,700
Well, me and Chandler looked for something to sleep on.

53
0:01:52,700 --> 0:01:54,900
This is what mattresses were like 100 years ago.

54
0:01:54,900 --> 0:01:56,100
Wait, you found a mattress?

55
0:01:56,100 --> 0:01:56,500
Yeah.

56
0:01:56,500 --> 0:01:57,000
Where?

57
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:58,200
On the second floor in the corner.

58
0:01:58,600 --> 0:02:01,900
That's all you.

59
0:02:01,900 --> 0:02:02,300
Thanks.

60
0:02:02,300 --> 0:02:04,900
You should wrap that thing in a tarp so you don't get destroyed by bugs.

61
0:02:04,900 --> 0:02:06,700
I'm going to wrap that mattress like a burrito.

62
0:02:06,700 --> 0:02:09,700
And while Chandler took his chances with their sketchy mattress,

63
0:02:09,700 --> 0:02:12,700
the rest of us decided to sleep on wooden doors.

64
0:02:12,700 --> 0:02:15,100
There's no shot that you're more comfortable than me right now.

65
0:02:15,100 --> 0:02:16,900
Oh, my back already hurts.

66
0:02:16,900 --> 0:02:19,600
There are so many buildings we have yet to explore in the city.

67
0:02:19,600 --> 0:02:21,400
Tomorrow's going to be insane.

68
0:02:21,400 --> 0:02:23,100
We'll see you in the morning.

69
0:02:23,100 --> 0:02:25,800
Even though our first day in the city went pretty smooth,

70
0:02:25,800 --> 0:02:29,100
something eerie did happen to occur later that night.

71
0:02:29,100 --> 0:02:31,600
While we were sleeping, Mark and some of the camera guys

72
0:02:31,600 --> 0:02:38,500
woke up to the sound of breaking glass not far from the camp,

73
0:02:38,500 --> 0:02:42,300
which made us start to wonder if we were really alone inside this city.

74
0:02:42,300 --> 0:02:44,500
What was it?

75
0:02:44,500 --> 0:02:46,200
I felt I saw something.

76
0:02:46,200 --> 0:02:48,100
But on top of the freaky noises,

77
0:02:48,100 --> 0:02:50,400
this shelter was way too windy to sleep.

78
0:02:50,400 --> 0:02:52,000
How'd you guys sleep?

79
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:52,600
Bad.

80
0:02:52,600 --> 0:02:55,500
So in pursuit of better sleep, we got up, got breakfast,

81
0:02:55,500 --> 0:02:57,200
and got prepared to find our new shelter.

82
0:02:57,200 --> 0:02:59,500
This is the first time I've had chili for breakfast,

83
0:02:59,500 --> 0:03:01,400
but I'm so hungry I kind of don't care.

84
0:03:01,400 --> 0:03:02,400
Well, since the raft.

85
0:03:02,400 --> 0:03:04,500
When have I ever been this excited over canned chili?

86
0:03:04,500 --> 0:03:06,400
I think my brain tried to forget about that thing.

87
0:03:06,400 --> 0:03:08,200
So after a nutritious breakfast,

88
0:03:08,200 --> 0:03:11,800
we took off our drone to seek out a new shelter in the unexplored buildings.

89
0:03:11,800 --> 0:03:13,200
We haven't explored that building.

90
0:03:13,200 --> 0:03:14,700
We haven't explored those hotels.

91
0:03:14,700 --> 0:03:16,400
It is an actual city here.

92
0:03:16,400 --> 0:03:18,300
However, upon scanning the buildings,

93
0:03:18,300 --> 0:03:20,600
we did stumble upon an unexpected guest.

94
0:03:20,600 --> 0:03:21,500
There's a cat.

95
0:03:21,500 --> 0:03:22,400
There's a cat down there.

96
0:03:22,400 --> 0:03:24,500
I'm going to land the drone right beside the cat.

97
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Oh, look at that shelter.

98
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Chris, look.

99
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:29,500
Oh, it's sniffing the camera.

100
0:03:29,500 --> 0:03:31,500
This cat has like no survival instinct.

101
0:03:31,500 --> 0:03:34,200
I promise we are not paying this cat to be an actor.

102
0:03:34,200 --> 0:03:35,900
As fun as playing with these cats is,

103
0:03:35,900 --> 0:03:38,200
we need to focus on shelter because it's going to be freezing tonight.

104
0:03:38,200 --> 0:03:41,400
And so we started our journey to find a sufficient shelter for the challenge.

105
0:03:41,400 --> 0:03:42,100
Ooh.

106
0:03:42,100 --> 0:03:43,500
Wait, what is this?

107
0:03:43,500 --> 0:03:44,600
Whoa.

108
0:03:44,600 --> 0:03:46,000
This is pretty.

109
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,500
It just has this type of like aesthetic to it

110
0:03:48,500 --> 0:03:50,700
that is like beautiful even though it's ugly.

111
0:03:50,700 --> 0:03:51,700
Zombie apocalypse.

112
0:03:51,700 --> 0:03:52,600
Aesthetic.

113
0:03:52,600 --> 0:03:53,600
Yeah, there you go.

114
0:03:53,600 --> 0:03:55,100
Wait, is that a pool?

115
0:03:55,100 --> 0:03:56,100
Wow.

116
0:03:56,100 --> 0:03:57,100
What the heck?

117
0:03:57,100 --> 0:03:58,400
It's so scary.

118
0:03:58,400 --> 0:04:01,300
Back in the day, this used to look something like this.

119
0:04:01,300 --> 0:04:04,000
And after decades of rotting from being abandoned,

120
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:05,700
this is what we're left with.

121
0:04:05,700 --> 0:04:07,400
Wait, there's a soccer field?

122
0:04:07,400 --> 0:04:09,600
The sport court.

123
0:04:09,600 --> 0:04:11,100
Is that a soccer ball?

124
0:04:12,200 --> 0:04:13,000
That was died.

125
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,200
I bet this soccer ball is older than me.

126
0:04:15,200 --> 0:04:17,400
Me older than all of us for sure.

127
0:04:17,400 --> 0:04:19,200
Well, besides Mark, he's older.

128
0:04:19,200 --> 0:04:20,100
We have two options now.

129
0:04:20,100 --> 0:04:22,500
We can keep exploring down this cool looking tunnel

130
0:04:22,500 --> 0:04:23,800
and go check out the neighborhood.

131
0:04:23,800 --> 0:04:26,200
Or with the hour of light we have left,

132
0:04:26,200 --> 0:04:28,400
we can prep for nighttime and not freeze all night.

133
0:04:28,400 --> 0:04:29,200
Not freeze.

134
0:04:29,200 --> 0:04:30,400
That sounds like a good idea.

135
0:04:30,400 --> 0:04:30,800
I agree.

136
0:04:30,800 --> 0:04:33,700
And after spending the entire day looking for a new shelter,

137
0:04:33,700 --> 0:04:36,700
I just can't get over how massive the city is.

138
0:04:36,700 --> 0:04:39,600
We finally found a place fortified enough to call home.

139
0:04:39,600 --> 0:04:40,700
So we don't freeze tonight.

140
0:04:40,700 --> 0:04:43,300
We're thinking of setting up camp in this room right here.

141
0:04:43,300 --> 0:04:44,900
We'll have a fire pit right here.

142
0:04:44,900 --> 0:04:46,600
We can tarp the wall right there.

143
0:04:46,600 --> 0:04:47,600
It's going to be comfy.

144
0:04:47,600 --> 0:04:48,900
Yeah, Mark's going to do all that.

145
0:04:48,900 --> 0:04:50,000
I said we.

146
0:04:50,000 --> 0:04:51,600
The only hard part is come over here.

147
0:04:51,600 --> 0:04:54,700
Our current camp and all our gear is all the way over there.

148
0:04:54,700 --> 0:04:56,300
I hope this place really works out

149
0:04:56,300 --> 0:04:57,700
because it's going to be a lot of effort to set up.

150
0:04:57,700 --> 0:05:00,500
With the sun getting low and the temperature rapidly dropping,

151
0:05:00,500 --> 0:05:02,700
we made our way back to the old camping spot

152
0:05:02,700 --> 0:05:04,500
and packed up to settle into the new base.

153
0:05:04,500 --> 0:05:06,700
We're heading to the new campsite.

154
0:05:06,700 --> 0:05:08,500
The new camp.

155
0:05:08,500 --> 0:05:09,500
The new camp.

156
0:05:09,500 --> 0:05:12,600
Okay, we got a lot of cleanup to do to prep this for tonight.

157
0:05:12,600 --> 0:05:15,500
This looks like a terrible place, but whatever.

158
0:05:15,500 --> 0:05:17,600
And after finding a more weatherproof base,

159
0:05:17,600 --> 0:05:20,600
we spent the next few hours dragging in as many of our belongings

160
0:05:20,600 --> 0:05:22,500
as we could before sundown.

161
0:05:26,100 --> 0:05:27,600
And because it got dark so fast,

162
0:05:27,600 --> 0:05:30,300
we couldn't bring all of our resources to the new base.

163
0:05:30,300 --> 0:05:32,900
So aside from one water bag, cans of chili

164
0:05:32,900 --> 0:05:35,500
and a couple old mattresses, this is all we had.

165
0:05:35,500 --> 0:05:37,700
What does everyone think of our new place?

166
0:05:37,700 --> 0:05:39,200
I like that there's no wind.

167
0:05:39,200 --> 0:05:40,800
It's much warmer.

168
0:05:40,800 --> 0:05:42,100
Chandler?

169
0:05:42,100 --> 0:05:42,800
What?

170
0:05:42,800 --> 0:05:45,500
It was now the third day of seven doing this challenge.

171
0:05:45,500 --> 0:05:47,700
And once we got up, we continued exploring.

172
0:05:47,700 --> 0:05:48,200
Be careful.

173
0:05:48,200 --> 0:05:49,600
These stairs are actually steep.

174
0:05:49,700 --> 0:05:52,900
On this whole staircase, three of the stairs are normal.

175
0:05:52,900 --> 0:05:54,300
This beach is nice.

176
0:05:54,300 --> 0:05:55,900
It actually smells like a beach.

177
0:05:55,900 --> 0:05:57,700
It's because it is a beach.

178
0:05:57,700 --> 0:05:58,700
But not too far in.

179
0:05:58,700 --> 0:06:00,700
Something strange happened.

180
0:06:00,700 --> 0:06:01,800
Can you guys see someone?

181
0:06:01,800 --> 0:06:02,800
What?

182
0:06:02,800 --> 0:06:05,300
Don't you see that reflecting thing over there under the stairs?

183
0:06:05,300 --> 0:06:06,100
Oh, I did.

184
0:06:06,100 --> 0:06:09,900
Jimmy, remember how we almost died the first night from glass bottle attack?

185
0:06:09,900 --> 0:06:12,200
I wonder if that's where the glass bottles came from.

186
0:06:12,200 --> 0:06:14,100
It was in this moment we realized

187
0:06:14,100 --> 0:06:17,400
we actually weren't alone in this abandoned city after all.

188
0:06:17,500 --> 0:06:21,000
And once our cameraman spotted this mysterious person on our drone,

189
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:22,600
we did what anyone else would do.

190
0:06:22,600 --> 0:06:23,500
Let's go check it out.

191
0:06:23,500 --> 0:06:25,100
Investigation.

192
0:06:25,100 --> 0:06:26,300
That building is sick.

193
0:06:26,300 --> 0:06:29,400
Why is this mansion beside this giant motel?

194
0:06:29,400 --> 0:06:33,200
Decades ago, this hotel stood as a first classification resort.

195
0:06:33,200 --> 0:06:37,700
By years of war, turned this once picturesque property into a city of ruins.

196
0:06:37,700 --> 0:06:39,500
Let's head on in.

197
0:06:39,500 --> 0:06:41,300
What did we just get ourselves into?

198
0:06:41,300 --> 0:06:45,500
We totally don't wait for the cameraman to walk in the room before we go in.

199
0:06:45,600 --> 0:06:48,000
Anyways, oh, it's getting dark.

200
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:50,000
Everyone, stop, stop.

201
0:06:50,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Candy.

202
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:51,800
What you going there?

203
0:06:51,800 --> 0:06:52,700
I'll go first.

204
0:06:52,700 --> 0:06:53,500
Okay, thank you.

205
0:06:53,500 --> 0:06:55,000
You think it's a Feastable's bar?

206
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:56,200
What the heck?

207
0:06:56,200 --> 0:06:57,900
This is starting to get very eerie.

208
0:06:57,900 --> 0:06:59,000
And I think Mark should go first.

209
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:00,600
What?

210
0:07:00,600 --> 0:07:02,400
Look how deep this hallway is.

211
0:07:02,400 --> 0:07:04,400
Also, if you fall over here, you might die.

212
0:07:04,400 --> 0:07:09,000
There's a very non-zero chance somebody could be in here and like attack us.

213
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:10,800
If someone attacked us, what do we do?

214
0:07:10,800 --> 0:07:11,600
Every man for himself.

215
0:07:11,600 --> 0:07:13,800
Yeah, whoever's the slowest just dies.

216
0:07:13,900 --> 0:07:15,900
Whoa, what's that light?

217
0:07:15,900 --> 0:07:17,300
Hello.

218
0:07:17,300 --> 0:07:19,100
I'm creeped out now, guys.

219
0:07:19,100 --> 0:07:21,600
We spent the rest of the day searching for the lurker.

220
0:07:21,600 --> 0:07:25,900
But once it started getting dark, we could only hope that later he wouldn't be looking for us.

221
0:07:25,900 --> 0:07:29,100
And now that it's dark out, here's what we've actually been waiting for.

222
0:07:29,100 --> 0:07:32,100
Give me big Bertha.

223
0:07:32,100 --> 0:07:32,900
Thank you.

224
0:07:32,900 --> 0:07:34,600
Oh, big Bertha.

225
0:07:34,600 --> 0:07:36,600
Notice how you can't see that building over there.

226
0:07:36,600 --> 0:07:39,500
This is the world's most powerful flashlight.

227
0:07:39,500 --> 0:07:40,700
Now you can.

228
0:07:40,700 --> 0:07:43,700
Bro, I bet the fish in the ocean are tripping.

229
0:07:44,200 --> 0:07:45,700
Oh, it stopped working.

230
0:07:45,700 --> 0:07:47,200
Hell, the mighty have fallen.

231
0:07:48,400 --> 0:07:51,900
The pluses of our actions is we got to play with the most strongest flashlight at night.

232
0:07:51,900 --> 0:07:54,800
The negatives of our actions is now we got to walk back in the dark.

233
0:07:54,800 --> 0:07:56,300
That was fantastic.

234
0:07:56,300 --> 0:07:58,600
Way scarier going through this place at night.

235
0:07:58,600 --> 0:07:59,900
Yeah, 1,000%.

236
0:07:59,900 --> 0:08:02,800
This really feels like the world has ended and we're just like surviving.

237
0:08:02,800 --> 0:08:06,600
So to avoid being murdered in cold blood, we went back to camp.

238
0:08:06,600 --> 0:08:08,700
We're back at camp.

239
0:08:08,700 --> 0:08:09,900
I'll get a fire going.

240
0:08:09,900 --> 0:08:10,700
I'm hungry.

241
0:08:10,700 --> 0:08:12,600
There's literally only chili blood.

242
0:08:12,600 --> 0:08:15,500
And so at the last of our supply here, we're feasting.

243
0:08:15,500 --> 0:08:19,100
Tomorrow, if we got some tables and seven chairs and more food, that'd be awesome.

244
0:08:19,100 --> 0:08:22,000
But when we woke up on the morning of day four out of seven,

245
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,900
we realized that we were already running low on supplies.

246
0:08:24,900 --> 0:08:26,900
Our bag of water is out of water.

247
0:08:26,900 --> 0:08:27,700
Do we have more?

248
0:08:27,700 --> 0:08:30,400
Point the camera at that roof all the way over there.

249
0:08:30,400 --> 0:08:33,900
I wish I had more than 100 calories in my body to go get it.

250
0:08:33,900 --> 0:08:35,300
Nose goes.

251
0:08:35,300 --> 0:08:36,600
What does nose goes mean?

252
0:08:36,600 --> 0:08:37,600
Sounds like you're going.

253
0:08:37,600 --> 0:08:38,400
He's going to need help.

254
0:08:38,400 --> 0:08:39,300
He can't carry it on his own.

255
0:08:39,300 --> 0:08:42,800
So Mark and Chandler set out to go all the way back to our original camping spot

256
0:08:42,800 --> 0:08:44,400
and get more supplies from the crate.

257
0:08:44,400 --> 0:08:46,700
Chandler, I wrote a side quest for water.

258
0:08:46,700 --> 0:08:47,600
This is a main quest.

259
0:08:47,600 --> 0:08:49,700
While they get the water, we don't want to be useless.

260
0:08:49,700 --> 0:08:50,900
We, I'm fine.

261
0:08:50,900 --> 0:08:52,800
I don't want us to be useless.

262
0:08:52,800 --> 0:08:55,100
So we're going to go try to find a table and some chairs.

263
0:08:55,100 --> 0:08:57,900
But we didn't get very far before Chris got distracted.

264
0:08:57,900 --> 0:09:00,200
Did we not know this was here?

265
0:09:00,200 --> 0:09:01,200
Jimmy!

266
0:09:01,200 --> 0:09:01,800
Yeah?

267
0:09:01,800 --> 0:09:03,200
I found a bike.

268
0:09:03,200 --> 0:09:04,900
That looks like a nice bike.

269
0:09:04,900 --> 0:09:05,800
Where'd you find that?

270
0:09:05,800 --> 0:09:06,500
In here.

271
0:09:06,500 --> 0:09:08,600
This is the coolest abandoned city ever.

272
0:09:08,600 --> 0:09:09,300
Having fun?

273
0:09:09,300 --> 0:09:10,300
I am.

274
0:09:10,300 --> 0:09:10,900
All right.

275
0:09:10,900 --> 0:09:12,100
I'm going to go look for a table.

276
0:09:12,100 --> 0:09:12,600
Okay.

277
0:09:12,600 --> 0:09:13,300
Let's go.

278
0:09:13,300 --> 0:09:15,900
How are we going to get the water out of this?

279
0:09:15,900 --> 0:09:17,300
Oh, it's heavy.

280
0:09:17,300 --> 0:09:20,100
The thought process is that this is a house.

281
0:09:20,100 --> 0:09:21,600
And what do people have in their house?

282
0:09:21,600 --> 0:09:22,400
Tables and chairs.

283
0:09:22,400 --> 0:09:23,300
Exactly.

284
0:09:23,300 --> 0:09:23,700
Wait.

285
0:09:23,700 --> 0:09:24,500
Hold up.

286
0:09:24,500 --> 0:09:25,200
Look at this.

287
0:09:25,200 --> 0:09:25,900
Don't move.

288
0:09:25,900 --> 0:09:26,600
Yes.

289
0:09:30,100 --> 0:09:30,900
It's a chair.

290
0:09:32,900 --> 0:09:34,100
Mark's strong.

291
0:09:34,100 --> 0:09:35,500
We'll help you, Chand.

292
0:09:35,500 --> 0:09:37,900
This bag of water is over 100 pounds.

293
0:09:37,900 --> 0:09:40,700
And so my buddy Mark, being the science YouTuber that he is,

294
0:09:40,700 --> 0:09:43,500
had an idea to get it down from the roof more effectively.

295
0:09:43,500 --> 0:09:44,200
But...

296
0:09:51,700 --> 0:09:53,600
I wrote wrong.

297
0:09:53,600 --> 0:09:55,200
We need stronger roads.

298
0:09:55,200 --> 0:09:56,700
What you're watching is real.

299
0:09:56,700 --> 0:09:59,300
Mark literally deleted half of our water.

300
0:09:59,300 --> 0:10:01,300
We got some bad news.

301
0:10:01,300 --> 0:10:02,100
Hurry up.

302
0:10:02,100 --> 0:10:03,300
Hurry up.

303
0:10:03,300 --> 0:10:07,200
The roof broke and all the water splattered on the ground.

304
0:10:07,200 --> 0:10:10,000
This was actually a very serious problem.

305
0:10:10,000 --> 0:10:11,500
Oh, no.

306
0:10:11,500 --> 0:10:12,500
Are you kidding me?

307
0:10:12,500 --> 0:10:13,900
Mark!

308
0:10:13,900 --> 0:10:14,900
Sorry!

309
0:10:14,900 --> 0:10:15,600
Don't worry, dude.

310
0:10:15,600 --> 0:10:17,300
We've got one bag of water left.

311
0:10:17,300 --> 0:10:18,800
Carry this one down, please.

312
0:10:18,800 --> 0:10:21,400
And now that half of our water is actually gone,

313
0:10:21,400 --> 0:10:24,300
the only possible way to complete this seven-day challenge

314
0:10:24,300 --> 0:10:26,800
would unfortunately be to send two of us home.

315
0:10:26,800 --> 0:10:29,100
So Chris and Chandler volunteered to leave the city,

316
0:10:29,100 --> 0:10:31,600
leaving Mark and I with just enough resources

317
0:10:31,600 --> 0:10:33,400
to make it the full seven days.

318
0:10:33,400 --> 0:10:35,900
Genuinely, I would be scared if we left Jimmy

319
0:10:35,900 --> 0:10:37,100
with anybody other than you.

320
0:10:37,200 --> 0:10:38,000
I thank you guys.

321
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Thank you guys.

322
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,800
But before they left, we wanted to have one final feast

323
0:10:41,800 --> 0:10:42,600
with the whole gang.

324
0:10:42,600 --> 0:10:44,000
Now that's a feastable smell.

325
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:44,700
Oh, my gosh.

326
0:10:44,700 --> 0:10:45,400
Mmm.

327
0:10:45,400 --> 0:10:46,700
My hair.

328
0:10:46,700 --> 0:10:47,200
Yummy.

329
0:10:47,200 --> 0:10:49,600
Great melting point on the chocolate, Jimmy, if I may.

330
0:10:49,600 --> 0:10:51,000
If you've tried feastables before,

331
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:52,800
the ones that used to look like this,

332
0:10:52,800 --> 0:10:53,900
you haven't tried feastables.

333
0:10:53,900 --> 0:10:56,000
Our brand-new formula tastes so much better.

334
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:58,200
Genuinely, go to Walmart, try feastables,

335
0:10:58,200 --> 0:10:59,200
and tell me what you think.

336
0:10:59,200 --> 0:11:01,800
It's honestly way better than the old formula,

337
0:11:01,800 --> 0:11:03,600
but don't take my word for it.

338
0:11:03,600 --> 0:11:05,000
I just worked at NASA.

339
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So...

340
0:11:08,100 --> 0:11:10,600
Well, I just had s'mores, so I can go to the boat now.

341
0:11:10,600 --> 0:11:13,100
And so we launched a flare to signal the boat,

342
0:11:13,100 --> 0:11:15,100
which was actually pretty cool.

343
0:11:15,100 --> 0:11:16,600
Bro, look how cool that looks.

344
0:11:16,600 --> 0:11:18,600
Wait, it's lighting up the entire city.

345
0:11:18,600 --> 0:11:19,600
Wow.

346
0:11:19,600 --> 0:11:22,100
But the not cool part is now that Chris and Chandler are gone,

347
0:11:22,100 --> 0:11:24,600
it's just Mark and I surviving in this city.

348
0:11:24,600 --> 0:11:26,100
I feel so lonely.

349
0:11:26,100 --> 0:11:28,100
It's the first day without our friends,

350
0:11:28,100 --> 0:11:30,100
but we're going to make the best of the situation.

351
0:11:30,100 --> 0:11:32,600
Our objective for today is to upgrade our shelter.

352
0:11:32,600 --> 0:11:34,600
We're going to put up tarps and windproof this room.

353
0:11:34,600 --> 0:11:37,100
We're going to build a fireplace in here and heat it up.

354
0:11:37,100 --> 0:11:38,600
We're going to find shelves and tables.

355
0:11:38,600 --> 0:11:40,600
We're going to make this place look like a home.

356
0:11:40,600 --> 0:11:42,100
With some of the ideas we have planned,

357
0:11:42,100 --> 0:11:44,100
I might stick around till day 14.

358
0:11:44,100 --> 0:11:45,100
He's lying.

359
0:11:45,100 --> 0:11:47,100
And so we started exploring some nearby buildings

360
0:11:47,100 --> 0:11:48,600
to find furnishing for our shelter,

361
0:11:48,600 --> 0:11:50,600
which is when we found this awesome shelf,

362
0:11:50,600 --> 0:11:53,100
this little table, a massive carpet,

363
0:11:53,100 --> 0:11:55,600
and also this metal thing that was found by our camera guy.

364
0:11:55,600 --> 0:11:57,100
Whoa, look at this chair.

365
0:11:57,100 --> 0:11:58,100
That works still, man.

366
0:11:58,100 --> 0:12:00,100
Bro, that's comfy.

367
0:12:02,100 --> 0:12:03,600
I found a fake TV.

368
0:12:03,600 --> 0:12:05,100
We can make it look like we have a TV now.

369
0:12:05,100 --> 0:12:06,100
It's a good find.

370
0:12:06,100 --> 0:12:08,100
Wow, that's just so cool.

371
0:12:08,100 --> 0:12:10,100
It's like courtyard with the arches.

372
0:12:10,100 --> 0:12:13,100
Each building in this city has like its own personality.

373
0:12:13,100 --> 0:12:14,100
What can we do with these?

374
0:12:14,100 --> 0:12:16,100
We could use like a vent system like this,

375
0:12:16,100 --> 0:12:17,100
combined with these.

376
0:12:17,100 --> 0:12:18,100
We can make a fireplace.

377
0:12:18,100 --> 0:12:20,100
Wow, I'm like actual wallpaper.

378
0:12:20,100 --> 0:12:21,100
We have wallpaper.

379
0:12:21,100 --> 0:12:22,100
What do we use it for?

380
0:12:22,100 --> 0:12:24,100
To make the house a home, Jimmy.

381
0:12:24,100 --> 0:12:26,100
It's like we went grocery shopping,

382
0:12:26,100 --> 0:12:28,100
but instead we grabbed a bunch of 30-year-old garbage.

383
0:12:28,100 --> 0:12:30,100
Honey, we're home.

384
0:12:30,100 --> 0:12:31,600
We found all this stuff.

385
0:12:31,600 --> 0:12:33,100
Now we're going to start decorating.

386
0:12:33,100 --> 0:12:34,600
We're no longer surviving, Jimmy.

387
0:12:34,600 --> 0:12:35,600
We're thriving.

388
0:12:35,600 --> 0:12:36,600
I like that.

389
0:12:36,600 --> 0:12:38,100
We literally spent the next four hours

390
0:12:38,100 --> 0:12:40,100
moving all of the rubble out of our shelter,

391
0:12:40,100 --> 0:12:41,600
which made us pretty thirsty.

392
0:12:41,600 --> 0:12:43,600
The water in these sacks tastes like trash.

393
0:12:43,600 --> 0:12:45,600
This is why we all brought a circle water bottle,

394
0:12:45,600 --> 0:12:47,100
because you can put a flavor cartridge in it

395
0:12:47,100 --> 0:12:48,100
and make water taste good.

396
0:12:48,100 --> 0:12:50,100
This is my first time drinking a circle bottle.

397
0:12:50,100 --> 0:12:51,600
Delightful experience.

398
0:12:51,600 --> 0:12:53,100
You can determine the intensity.

399
0:12:53,100 --> 0:12:54,600
So if you're feeling really audacious,

400
0:12:54,600 --> 0:12:56,600
you can have level nine flavor.

401
0:12:56,600 --> 0:12:57,600
Or if you're just a wuss,

402
0:12:57,600 --> 0:12:58,600
you can have level one flavor.

403
0:12:58,600 --> 0:12:59,600
We'll try a six.

404
0:12:59,600 --> 0:13:01,100
Six. I'll match your six.

405
0:13:01,100 --> 0:13:02,100
That tastes awesome.

406
0:13:02,600 --> 0:13:04,600
Which flavor are you using?

407
0:13:04,600 --> 0:13:05,600
I'm rocking fruit punch,

408
0:13:05,600 --> 0:13:06,600
because it's got energy.

409
0:13:06,600 --> 0:13:08,100
And you know what we need right now, Jimmy?

410
0:13:08,100 --> 0:13:09,100
Energy.

411
0:13:09,100 --> 0:13:10,100
That's right.

412
0:13:10,100 --> 0:13:11,100
Good thing Circle has our bag.

413
0:13:11,100 --> 0:13:12,600
And now that we had been hydrated,

414
0:13:12,600 --> 0:13:14,600
it was time to start crushing these renovations.

415
0:13:14,600 --> 0:13:16,100
When everything's said and done,

416
0:13:16,100 --> 0:13:17,600
this room will be the greatest room

417
0:13:17,600 --> 0:13:19,600
in an abandoned city you've ever seen.

418
0:13:19,600 --> 0:13:20,600
This is our new shelf.

419
0:13:20,600 --> 0:13:22,100
All right, let's see how she likes.

420
0:13:22,100 --> 0:13:23,600
See that? See how that does?

421
0:13:23,600 --> 0:13:25,600
Oh, isn't that satisfying?

422
0:13:25,600 --> 0:13:26,600
And now that the shelf is clean,

423
0:13:26,600 --> 0:13:28,100
we can use it to store food.

424
0:13:28,100 --> 0:13:29,600
For some reason, over half the food

425
0:13:29,600 --> 0:13:30,600
we packed is chili.

426
0:13:30,600 --> 0:13:31,600
And no one here likes chili.

427
0:13:31,600 --> 0:13:33,100
That's the non-chili row.

428
0:13:33,100 --> 0:13:34,100
That's the chili row.

429
0:13:34,100 --> 0:13:35,100
This is the feastables row.

430
0:13:35,100 --> 0:13:36,100
Right there.

431
0:13:36,100 --> 0:13:37,100
Now we have a table

432
0:13:37,100 --> 0:13:39,100
to put our circle water bottles.

433
0:13:39,100 --> 0:13:40,100
Mark has a 22-ounce bottle.

434
0:13:40,100 --> 0:13:41,600
This is the 32-ounce bottle.

435
0:13:41,600 --> 0:13:43,600
And they have a metal double-insulated bottle

436
0:13:43,600 --> 0:13:45,100
that you can get for free right now

437
0:13:45,100 --> 0:13:46,600
if you buy 10 flavor cartridges.

438
0:13:46,600 --> 0:13:47,600
What a steal.

439
0:13:47,600 --> 0:13:48,600
No, it's not a steal. It's free.

440
0:13:48,600 --> 0:13:49,600
Oh.

441
0:13:50,600 --> 0:13:51,600
All right.

442
0:13:51,600 --> 0:13:53,100
That's gonna block a lot of wind.

443
0:13:53,100 --> 0:13:54,600
And with our new door in place,

444
0:13:54,600 --> 0:13:56,100
we also hung up this huge tarp,

445
0:13:56,100 --> 0:13:58,100
which will allow us to keep all the heat

446
0:13:58,100 --> 0:14:00,100
from the fireplace inside our shelter.

447
0:14:00,100 --> 0:14:01,600
Oxygen comes in,

448
0:14:01,600 --> 0:14:02,600
fire burns,

449
0:14:02,600 --> 0:14:03,600
sends heat in the room,

450
0:14:03,600 --> 0:14:04,600
sends smoke out.

451
0:14:04,600 --> 0:14:06,600
This is Redneck Engineering at its finest.

452
0:14:06,600 --> 0:14:08,600
And finally, after being cold for so long,

453
0:14:08,600 --> 0:14:09,600
all right.

454
0:14:09,600 --> 0:14:10,600
Look at that.

455
0:14:10,600 --> 0:14:12,100
And we have a fire.

456
0:14:12,100 --> 0:14:13,600
I can feel the heat coming out.

457
0:14:13,600 --> 0:14:15,600
We do rig this up with, like, ruins

458
0:14:15,600 --> 0:14:17,100
from an abandoned city.

459
0:14:17,100 --> 0:14:18,600
Anyway, go to drinkscircle.com

460
0:14:18,600 --> 0:14:19,600
slash Mr. B's

461
0:14:19,600 --> 0:14:21,600
or scan the QR code on his face

462
0:14:21,600 --> 0:14:23,100
if you want to order a circle right now.

463
0:14:23,100 --> 0:14:24,600
This is the final room.

464
0:14:24,600 --> 0:14:25,600
We have plenty in the corner.

465
0:14:25,600 --> 0:14:27,600
We have our beds that are now smaller.

466
0:14:27,600 --> 0:14:29,100
Tell me this isn't genius.

467
0:14:29,100 --> 0:14:31,600
This is Mark's iPad in the TV frame.

468
0:14:31,600 --> 0:14:33,600
Obviously, some nice lighting.

469
0:14:33,600 --> 0:14:35,600
A furnace that is heating up the room.

470
0:14:35,600 --> 0:14:37,600
A real table with chairs

471
0:14:37,600 --> 0:14:38,600
and a shelving unit

472
0:14:38,600 --> 0:14:40,600
with the scraps of food we have left.

473
0:14:40,600 --> 0:14:42,600
And a dirty towel we've been sharing.

474
0:14:42,600 --> 0:14:43,600
This is survival.

475
0:14:43,600 --> 0:14:45,600
But just as our night was going so well

476
0:14:45,600 --> 0:14:47,600
for the fifth day in a row,

477
0:14:47,600 --> 0:14:49,600
we heard broken glass.

478
0:14:49,600 --> 0:14:51,600
Mark, I'm right here, dog.

479
0:14:51,600 --> 0:14:52,600
What was that?

480
0:14:52,600 --> 0:14:54,600
Man, we were having such a good day, too.

481
0:14:54,600 --> 0:14:56,600
I want to go see who's upstairs.

482
0:14:56,600 --> 0:14:57,600
I'm carrying the knife as a threat,

483
0:14:58,100 --> 0:14:59,100
but I'm not going to use it.

484
0:14:59,100 --> 0:15:01,100
Hey, if you're up here,

485
0:15:01,100 --> 0:15:02,100
just come out.

486
0:15:02,100 --> 0:15:03,100
I want to be best friends with you.

487
0:15:03,100 --> 0:15:04,100
Are you serious?

488
0:15:04,100 --> 0:15:05,100
You're not pranking me, bro.

489
0:15:05,100 --> 0:15:07,100
I swear to you, it was not me.

490
0:15:07,100 --> 0:15:09,100
Hello?

491
0:15:09,100 --> 0:15:11,100
What is this?

492
0:15:11,100 --> 0:15:12,100
What?

493
0:15:12,100 --> 0:15:13,100
Oh, my gosh.

494
0:15:13,100 --> 0:15:15,100
This is the most Mark Rover thing I've ever seen.

495
0:15:17,100 --> 0:15:18,100
What the heck?

496
0:15:18,100 --> 0:15:19,100
You swore!

497
0:15:19,100 --> 0:15:21,100
So it turns out Mark was pranking us

498
0:15:21,100 --> 0:15:23,100
and he was the one dropping bottles this whole time.

499
0:15:23,100 --> 0:15:25,100
I've got a remote control here

500
0:15:25,100 --> 0:15:26,100
but no one suspects it.

501
0:15:26,100 --> 0:15:27,600
I can put my sleeping bag

502
0:15:27,600 --> 0:15:29,600
and I can start launching glass bottles from the roof,

503
0:15:29,600 --> 0:15:30,600
freak everyone out.

504
0:15:30,600 --> 0:15:31,600
Oh, my gosh.

505
0:15:31,600 --> 0:15:33,600
I thought I could trust you.

506
0:15:33,600 --> 0:15:34,600
Boom!

507
0:15:34,600 --> 0:15:36,600
Now that Mark's not pranking me,

508
0:15:36,600 --> 0:15:38,600
we re-rigged his contraption.

509
0:15:38,600 --> 0:15:39,600
He smells me.

510
0:15:40,600 --> 0:15:41,600
Here you go.

511
0:15:41,600 --> 0:15:42,600
I'll take one.

512
0:15:43,600 --> 0:15:44,600
I got one as well.

513
0:15:44,600 --> 0:15:45,600
That's kind of cool.

514
0:15:47,600 --> 0:15:49,600
To be honest, it was pretty easy to forgive Mark

515
0:15:49,600 --> 0:15:52,600
because we only had one day left in the challenge.

516
0:15:52,600 --> 0:15:53,600
Good morning!

517
0:15:54,100 --> 0:15:55,100
Good morning!

518
0:15:55,100 --> 0:15:57,100
Abandoned city!

519
0:15:57,100 --> 0:15:59,100
Abandoned city!

520
0:15:59,100 --> 0:16:00,100
Abandoned city!

521
0:16:00,100 --> 0:16:02,100
There's so much colder out here than it is in there.

522
0:16:03,100 --> 0:16:04,100
Let's go back!

523
0:16:04,100 --> 0:16:06,100
It's now the morning of day six.

524
0:16:06,100 --> 0:16:08,100
All the modifications we did were phenomenal

525
0:16:08,100 --> 0:16:10,100
and it was at least 10 degrees warmer.

526
0:16:10,100 --> 0:16:11,100
That was amazing.

527
0:16:11,100 --> 0:16:12,100
It slept incredible.

528
0:16:12,100 --> 0:16:14,100
Mark, on our last real day,

529
0:16:14,100 --> 0:16:16,100
I say we go have some fun.

530
0:16:19,100 --> 0:16:20,100
Yeah!

531
0:16:20,100 --> 0:16:22,100
Jimmy, is that a kayak?

532
0:16:22,100 --> 0:16:23,100
I know what we should do with it.

533
0:16:23,600 --> 0:16:24,600
Ah!

534
0:16:24,600 --> 0:16:25,600
Oh!

535
0:16:25,600 --> 0:16:27,600
Now someone can kayak in this pool.

536
0:16:27,600 --> 0:16:29,600
Me and Mark really did have a lot of fun.

537
0:16:29,600 --> 0:16:30,600
We played baseball,

538
0:16:30,600 --> 0:16:31,600
we played soccer,

539
0:16:31,600 --> 0:16:33,600
Mark even taught me how to skip rocks,

540
0:16:33,600 --> 0:16:34,600
scientifically,

541
0:16:34,600 --> 0:16:36,600
and even screaming at each other

542
0:16:36,600 --> 0:16:38,600
from different sides of the city.

543
0:16:38,600 --> 0:16:39,600
Mark!

544
0:16:39,600 --> 0:16:42,600
Let's throw these off the roof at the same time!

545
0:16:42,600 --> 0:16:44,600
Great idea!

546
0:16:44,600 --> 0:16:45,600
To be honest,

547
0:16:45,600 --> 0:16:47,600
doing all these kind of dumb things

548
0:16:47,600 --> 0:16:49,600
really did take our minds off of

549
0:16:49,600 --> 0:16:51,600
how lonely the city really was.

550
0:16:52,100 --> 0:16:54,100
And by the time the final day

551
0:16:54,100 --> 0:16:55,100
of this challenge arrived,

552
0:16:55,100 --> 0:16:56,100
after cleaning up camp,

553
0:16:56,100 --> 0:16:58,100
we only had one objective in mind.

554
0:16:59,100 --> 0:17:00,100
Leaving this place

555
0:17:00,100 --> 0:17:02,100
and never coming back.

556
0:17:04,100 --> 0:17:05,100
Right here!

557
0:17:05,100 --> 0:17:06,100
Frito!

558
0:17:06,100 --> 0:17:08,100
Huge shout out to Mark.

559
0:17:08,100 --> 0:17:09,100
He didn't have to do this.

560
0:17:09,100 --> 0:17:10,100
He has his own channel.

561
0:17:10,100 --> 0:17:11,100
He's very busy.

562
0:17:11,100 --> 0:17:12,100
Here's his channel.

563
0:17:12,100 --> 0:17:13,100
I appreciate you.

564
0:17:13,100 --> 0:17:14,100
And let's get out of here.

565
0:17:14,100 --> 0:17:15,100
Let's go!

566
0:17:15,100 --> 0:17:16,100
By the way,

567
0:17:16,100 --> 0:17:17,100
I'm giving away $10,000 a day

568
0:17:17,100 --> 0:17:19,100
every day for the next 15 days

569
0:17:19,100 --> 0:17:21,100
to random people who buy our new feastings bar.

570
0:17:21,100 --> 0:17:22,100
Go buy the new formula.

571
0:17:22,100 --> 0:17:23,100
It tastes amazing.
